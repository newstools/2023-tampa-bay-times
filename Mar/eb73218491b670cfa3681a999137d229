TAMPA — The Bucs have informed veteran tight end Cameron Brate they plan to release him in the coming days, part of an ongoing effort to become salary cap compliant by the middle of the month, the Tampa Bay Times has learned. One of the franchise’s most improbable success stories, Brate, 31, could test the free-agent waters or — more likely — retire. His release works out to a cap savings of slightly under $2 million. The Bucs, currently $56 million over the cap, must be under it by 4 p.m. March 15. They also have informed veteran tailback Leonard Fournette of his upcoming release (roughly $3.5 million in savings) and could part with other veterans such as left tackle Donovan Smith and kicker Ryan Succop in the coming days. Undrafted out of Harvard in 2014, Brate finishes his Bucs career with 273 regular-season catches for 2,857 yards. His 33 regular-season touchdown receptions are third most in franchise history — one shy of fellow tight end Jimmie Giles — and his 221 playoff receiving yards are second most by a Tampa Bay tight end behind only Rob Gronkowski (226). He sustained the most frightening injury of his career this past season, when he was carted off the field Oct. 16 in Pittsburgh after taking a hit from Steelers linebacker Myles Jack upon catching a short pass over the middle. The neck injury sidelined Brate three games, and he managed only seven catches the rest of the regular season. But if Brady remains retired, Brate will remain the answer to one of the NFL’s consummate trivia questions, having caught an 8-yard scoring pass from the quarterback — the last TD throw of his 23-year career — with 2:04 to play in the Bucs’ 31-14 playoff loss to the Cowboys. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
