A 2-year-old boy from Wesley Chapel is dead after being struck by an SUV driven by his grandmother while he was walking between the SUV and a stranded vehicle the woman was trying to help on Friday, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The 58-year-old Wesley Chapel woman was backing up on Schambeau Road, south of State Road 52, to help a motorist who was stranded on a dirt road around 4:49 p.m. Troopers say the toddler walked between the two vehicles and was hit. The boy was airlifted to a local hospital, where he died, the agency said in a news release Friday night. The Highway Patrol did not name the woman or the child.
