TAMPA — Incumbent Lynn Hurtak and former state Sen. Janet Cruz are headed for a runoff for the citywide District 3 seat on Tampa City Council, a race seen as a proxy battle over providing a check on the mayor’s office. Seminole Heights resident Hurtak received 42.5% of votes. Cruz, the mother of Mayor Jane Castor’s long-time partner and Sunset Park resident, received 38.8%, with all precincts reporting. The pair will square off April 25 because they received the two highest votes shares Tuesday night in a crowded field that saw no candidate secure a majority. Three other opponents vied for the seat: K.J. Allen, 31, a counselor with an afterschool YMCA program; George “the Hunted” Feshev, 52, spurred to run for office after surviving a gunshot to the head; and Jose Vazquez, 48, who owns a transport, towing and storage company. Hurtak, 45, has pushed back against Castor on issues including the wastewater reuse project called PURE and supported the effort to rein in mayoral power. She was appointed to her City Council seat in April after John Dingfelder resigned to resolve a public records lawsuit. “I’m so grateful for all the supporters,” she told the Times Tuesday night, once votes were tallied. “I’ve only been on this job for 10 months, and for so many people to recognize what I’m doing just means the world.” She feels “fantastic” heading into the runoff, she said. Cruz, who the mayor endorsed, had said experience as a legislator in Tallahassee for 13 years gives her inside knowledge of how to help Tampa with state resources. She’s the mother of Ana Cruz, Castor’s partner and a lobbyist with the Ballard Partners. “I’m humbled by the support that we received in the primary,” Cruz, 66, said in a statement Tuesday. “It’s clear that the people of Tampa want change and I’m honored to be able to lead that charge.”
