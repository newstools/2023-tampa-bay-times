The Rays’ extended family, Tampa Bay area and Major League Baseball, as well as his hometown of Chicago, were shocked to wake up to the news Sunday morning of the death of Rays radio broadcaster Dave Wills. The Rays canceled a planned radio broadcast of Sunday’s exhibition against the Orioles and observed a moment of silence before the game. The team will honor Wills with a special pregame tribute during the season, with details to be announced at a later date. In the meantime, teams, colleagues, and radio listeners took to social media to express condolences, post tributes and share stories of their interactions with the convivial Wills, 58, who called Rays games for the past 18 seasons after 11 with the White Sox. Here is a sampling of what they had to say: • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
