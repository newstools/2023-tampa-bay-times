Gasparilla Music Festival is returning to Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park in downtown Tampa April 29-30. A limited number of early bird tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday at gmftickets.com. The festival typically happens at Curtis Hixon Park and nearby Kiley Garden in February or March, but organizers had postpone it to look for another venue due to Kiley Garden being closed for water intrusion issues. David Cox, executive director of the Gasparilla Music Foundation, said in an email that because they can’t use Kiley Garden, changes have been made to the festival’s programming. “These changes have opened up some new opportunities to expand our footprint and create some exciting new experiences for GMF 2023,” he wrote. “We look forward to sharing those along with an incredible lineup in the coming weeks.” Cox said next year’s festival will happen on Feb. 16-18 at Tampa’s Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park.
