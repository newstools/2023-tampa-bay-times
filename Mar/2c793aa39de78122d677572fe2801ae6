The worlds of food and art are set to collide in St. Petersburg’s Warehouse Arts District, with upcoming culinary center The Foodie Labs set to open in April. Located among the art studios and galleries at the ArtsXChange, the lab aims to provide a “creative showcase for chefs, virtual restaurants, caterers and foodies.” The lab will feature eight commercial cook stations, a main baking station, a professional demonstration kitchen, event space, and a pop-up cafe experience. Partners Jim Pachence and Kristin McKinney Zelinsky are the center’s owners. Pachence is a former biotech scientist who is the owner of Serious Foodie, which makes sauces and spice rubs. Zelinsky is the owner of Pro Kitchen Hub in Tampa and a culinary professional with 25 years of catering experience. “Our longtime dream of bringing an innovative culinary space to St. Pete is about to become a reality,” Pachence said in a news release. “We’re excited about the positive impact we can make on the community alongside the ArtsXChange.” There will be a food hall with six restaurant residencies and a grab-and-go pickup window and delivery service. The test/commercial kitchen will give chefs, caterers and food truck operators 24-hour access. Special events and pop-up cafes will happen in the professional demonstration kitchen, which will also be available for food photography, videography and styling. Additionally, a mentoring and marketing program for aspiring chefs and food entrepreneurs will include necessary certifications, licensing, classes and networking. The lab plans to feature local artists and musicians during events. For more information, visit thefoodielabs.com. The ArtsXChange is located at 515 22nd St. S.
