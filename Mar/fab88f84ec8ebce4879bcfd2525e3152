On Sunday morning, 8,000 runners will cross the northbound lanes of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, which means traffic that direction will be diverted from 3:30 a.m. until 11 a.m. The annual Armed Forces Skyway 10k will have human traffic crossing the bridge, instead. The southbound lanes will remain open with no stopping permitted. Northbound traffic will be detoured from I-275 to U.S. Highway 41. Both sides of the Skyway fishing piers will be closed at midnight until after the race. Last year, a driver sped around barricades toward the runners during the Skyway 10K until Trooper Toni Schuck stopped her by veering her Florida Highway Patrol vehicle into the path of the car. The driver had a blood-alcohol level more than three times the legal limit. Last month, Schuck was named the highway patrolâ€™s 2022 Trooper of the Year for her actions that day.
