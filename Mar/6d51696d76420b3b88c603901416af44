Tampa International Airport is partnering with Uber Eats for mobile ordering. Uber Eats will offer the airport’s “TPA to Go” program on their app for passengers and visitors to order food and drinks through their phone. Tampa is the first airport in the U.S. to partner with Uber Eats, according to a news release. Tampa has 18 restaurants and four retailers from which customers can order ahead and skip the line. Uber Eats doesn’t offer delivery within the airport, the release said, and users must pick up their items. The partnership comes right in time for the airport’s busiest season: Spring break. About 90,000 passengers are expected to go through the Tampa airport during peak days between March 7 and April 10, airport officials said. “At Uber, we know how busy airports can be and that sometimes travel can be stressful,” said Rob Mitchell, head of airports business development at Uber, in a statement. “That’s why we’re excited to give travelers and folks who work at the airport a lot more convenience and a little less stress when they’re hungry by bringing Uber Eats skip-the-line mobile ordering technology at restaurant and retail locations at Tampa International Airport.” Tampa International is the “first official U.S. airport partner” with Uber. But Uber Eats worked at Toronto Pearson Airport and launched pilot programs in John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Ohio and Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina in the past. “Our partnership with Uber Eats is another way we’re elevating the guest experience by making shopping and dining at TPA easier and faster, which is a great value for our customers,” said Laurie Noyes, vice president of concessions and commercial parking at the Tampa airport.
