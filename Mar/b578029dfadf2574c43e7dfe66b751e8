TAMPA — Jamel Dean was considered one of the top five free agents available when the negotiating period began Monday. But the 26-year-old cornerback is staying home after agreeing to a four-year, $52 million deal (with $26 million guaranteed) with the Bucs. It’s a remarkable development for the team, which was more than $57 million over the $224.8 million salary cap only a few weeks ago. After having signed Carlton Davis to a three-year, $44.5 million contract last March, the Bucs have now secured their bookend cornerbacks for Todd Bowles’ defense. Dean was ranked fifth among the top free agents available by Pro Football Focus. Last season, Dean started 15 regular-season games and had two interceptions and eight passes defensed. Also on Monday, defensive tackle Rakeem-Nunez Roches used social media to say goodbye to Bucs fans. Minutes later, multiple reports confirmed Nunez-Roches had agreed to a contract with the Giants.
