It’s been 15 years since Robert Smith and company have made an appearance in Tampa. Great news for local goths: The Cure is breaking its streak this summer, returning to Amalie Arena on June 29. It’s the same venue the band played the last time they were in town on June 11, 2008, back when it was called the St. Pete Times Forum. The 30-stop North American tour, titled “Shows of a Lost World,” is in support of The Cure’s much-anticipated album, “Songs of a Lost World.” The Twilight Sad will open.
