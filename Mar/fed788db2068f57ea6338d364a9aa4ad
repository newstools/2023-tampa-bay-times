A wrong-way driver died after colliding with another vehicle in Hillsborough County early Sunday morning, according to law enforcement. The 35-year-old man from San Antonio, Texas, was driving east in a pickup truck in the westbound lanes of State Road 60, just west of the Polk County line, “for unknown reason,” the Florida Highway Patrol said in a news release. He crashed head-on with a semitrailer traveling west and spun into the highway’s eastbound lanes, police said. He was not wearing a seatbelt, police said, and suffered fatal injuries at the scene of the crash. Behind the wheel of the semitrailer was a 31-year-old man from Haines City. He came to a stop in the westbound lanes and suffered minor injuries. At least three motorcyclists and 11 pedestrians have been killed in Hillsborough County since the start of the year, according to estimates from Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles published in mid-February.
