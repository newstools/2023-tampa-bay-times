A 12th grader has become the third person to be arrested in a shooting last December that killed 15-year-old Zykiqurio Lofton, according to the St. Petersburg Police Department. Jeremiah Davis, 18, was arrested at Gibbs High School when class was dismissed Friday, the agency said in a news release. Officers say he was in possession of a handgun when he was taken into custody.
