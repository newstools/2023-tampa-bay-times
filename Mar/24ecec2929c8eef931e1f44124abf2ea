NORTH PORT — All-Star lefty Shane McClanahan makes his first spring start today as the Rays face the Braves, with first pitch at 1:05 p.m. McClanahan said he spent the offseason working hard on conditioning and other aspects of his game, and he has been eager to advance through each stage of the spring, from bullpen sessions to live batting and now to his first game: “(Wednesday) feels like the start of my season.” Ben Gamel, a recent addition to camp on a minor-league contract, will make his Rays debut. The lefty hitter has played primarily outfield during his parts of seven seasons in the majors, but the Rays also want to take a look at him at first base, where he will play today. Also of note, this is is likely the last appearance for catcher Christian Bethancourt before he leaves to join the Panama team in Taiwan for the World Baseball Classic.
