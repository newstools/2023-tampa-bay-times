TAMPA — The Lightning’s 5-2 win Tuesday night over the Flyers was expected to be a physical matchup, but in the final minutes of the game blue gloves went flying along the ice as Tampa Bay players went after Flyers defenseman Tony DeAngelo for spearing Lightning forward Corey Perry. With the Lightning up 4-2 with 2:40 remaining in regulation, a crowd gathered in front of the Lightning net following a whistle, and DeAngelo skated into the group and and ran the blade of his stick into Perry’s groin, dropping him to the ice in pain. That prompted the Lightning’s four other skaters to chase DeAngelo down the ice and eventually dogpile on top of him, as well as the ejection of DeAngelo from the game. DeAngelo received a five-minute spearing major and a 10-minute game misconduct penalty that means an automatic ejection. DeAngelo is also looking at further discipline following a review by the league’s department of player safety. DeAngelo had to be restrained by an official as he was escorted to the Flyers bench and off the ice, jawing with Perry and other Lightning players throughout. The penalty led to a Lightning power play, and Tampa Bay put the game away with the man advantage on Nikita Kucherov’s second goal of the night, making it 5-2. Perry doesn’t hide that he’s an agitator, but it’s unclear what prompted the low blow by DeAngelo, a former first-round pick of the Lightning in 2014. • • • Sign up for Lightning Strikes, a weekly newsletter from Bolts beat writer Eduardo A.
