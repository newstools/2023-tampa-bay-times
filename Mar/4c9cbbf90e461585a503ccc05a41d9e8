TAMPA — Top prospect Taj Bradley will make his second spring start today when the Rays play the Yankees at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, first pitch 1:05. Bradley made an impressive major-league exhibition debut last Sunday against the Red Sox, retiring the side, including All-Star Rafael Devers, on seven total pitches. He is scheduled for two innings today and to  face several veteran hitters, including Anthony Rizzo, Josh Donaldson and Aaron Hicks. Luis Severino will start for the Yankees. Several Rays who are headed to the World Baseball Classic are playing their last game or two for this part of spring training, including outfielder Randy Arozarena, who will play in Arizona for Mexico. Infielder/outfielder Vidal Brujan, who was hit by a pitch behind his left shoulder Friday, was fine today, manager Kevin Cash said.
