Dozens of current and former pediatric patients, along with family members and friends, took part in their own arcade-themed prom held at the hospital Friday. The evening included music, dancing, refreshments and photos. The Child Life team at St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital organizes special events in an effort to provide patients with experiences that may never have the opportunity to enjoy. “This is a great milestone event,” said Child life specialist, Karlyn Crawford. “It gives a chance for the kids to be kids.”
