PALM HARBOR — Add defending U.S. Open Champion Matt Fitzpatrick and former U.S. Open champion Justin Rose to the growing list of recognizable names committed to play in next week’s Valspar Championship. Rose and Fitzpatrick join a field that already includes Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald and two-time defending champion Sam Burns. That gives the tournament four of the world’s top 15 golfers: Thomas (No. 9), Fitzpatrick (12), Burns (14) and Spieth (15). Fitzpatrick, 28, of England won the U.S. Open in June at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts. He has eight wins on the DP World Tour and won the 2013 U.S. Amateur while a student at Northwestern. He tied for fifth at last year’s Valspar Championship. Rose, 42, of England, won the 2013 U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. The winner of the gold medal at the  2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and 2018 FedEx Cup, he is coming off his 11th career PGA Tour win last month at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He is ranked No. 37 in the world. Kevin Kisner, ranked 45th, also committed to play at Valspar. The winner of four PGA Tour titles, Kisner, 39, of the United States, gives the tournament nine of the world’s top 50 golfers. Players have until 5 p.m. Friday to join the field for the PGA Tour event March 16-19 at Innisbrook Golf and Spa Resort.
