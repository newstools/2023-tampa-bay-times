Tyrone Square Mall in St. Petersburg could soon get another grocer. European-discount grocer Aldi is planned to fill in the space left by two other supermarkets, according to a Tyrone Square Mall site plan from Seritage Growth Properties. The plans are posted on the developer’s website and shows the grocer space as currently leased. Seritage Growth Properties, the New-York based real estate firm leasing the space, and Aldi did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment. There’s no opening date announced yet. The 28,605-square-foot space has been empty since summer when Alachua-based Hitchcock Green Market closed its doors. Before that, it used to be home to a Lucky’s Market — a chain that abruptly left Florida in 2019. Aldi, a supermarket chain based in Germany, was the fastest growing grocer in the U.S. in 2022 — specifically in the Southeast and the Gulf Coast, said a report from commercial real estate firm JLL published in January. Its rapid expansion has made it the third-largest grocery chain in the nation with more than 2,270 stores. Having an Aldi store near can also raise home prices more than other grocers. Homes near Aldi stores nationwide grew about 58% between 2017 and 2022, a study by real estate data company ATTOM found, higher than Trader Joe’s at 49% and Whole Foods at 45%. There’s about 108,710 people living within 3 miles of Tyrone Square Mall, according to Seritage. Aldi has two other St. Petersburg stores in North Kenwood and the Skyway Marina District.
