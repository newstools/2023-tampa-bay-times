ST. PETERSBURG — Free-agent addition Zach Eflin will make his first spring start for the Rays today as they host the Twins in the first of 13 exhibition games at Tropicana Field. Eflin left the Phillies as a free agent and signed a three-year, $40 million deal with the Rays. Several of the front-line hitters are in the lineup, including Wander Franco, Manuel Margot and Randy Arozarena. Forced to find a new training site after their Port Charlotte facility sustained extensive damage in Hurricane Ian, the Rays held the first two weeks of camp, and played one game, at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. They relocated Wednesday to the Trop, and they also will send players do work outside at the nearby Huggins-Stengel complex. The Rays have occasionally played an exhibition at the Trop at the end of the spring to acclimate their players to the quirks of the building, but this is the first time they have played the bulk of their home spring games there. Tickets are $10-$50 and available via the MLB Ballpark app and raysbaseball.com. Here is the Rays lineup: And for the Twins, and manager Rocco Baldelli: • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
