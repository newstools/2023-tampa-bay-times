Now in its eighth year, Busch Gardens Food and Wine Festival returns March 10 with appetizer-sized dishes, drinks and a concert series that includes Kansas, Flo Rida, Walk the Moon and Dustin Lynch. The festival runs on weekends through May 21. Though the food and drink options cost extra (from $6 to $12), the concerts are included with admission. The park has followed the trend of plant-based desires from its customers and upped its vegetarian options to include a vegetable samosa with peppadew-tomato chutney, which is a flaky pastry filled with spiced potatoes, onions and peas. Thereâ€™s also a vegetarian African vegetable curry and naan among the new food items this year. The Greek Isles kiosk will offer stuffed grape leaves with tzatziki sauce and a lamb lollipop with a mint demi-glace (both gluten free). The Latin Twist stand will have a chimichurri beef skewer, mojo pork taco and, for dessert, a pina colada trifle, which is a vanilla cake with vanilla pudding, pineapple, coconut and whipped topping. Other offerings at the festival include a twist on egg rolls with Buffalo chicken and Philly cheese steak options and an Asian-inspired spicy pork belly with mandarin orange soy glaze. A 10-item sampler lanyard is $70 and a 15-item pass is $85 at buschgardens.com. The concert series is included with admission, though you can buy premium seating for $49.99.
