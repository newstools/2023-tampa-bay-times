SAFETY HARBOR â€” An 86-year-old man was arrested Friday night for leaving the scene of an accident that killed a bicyclist. Timothy Rush, who lives in Clearwater, had contacted investigators on Friday asking them to call him back. He was taken into custody after they found his Buick Enclave had a shattered windshield, broken headlight and purple paint on the front passenger bumper, which matched the bicycle that had been hit. The cyclist, Mindy Miran Yi, 36, had been heading west on Enterprise Road Thursday night when she was struck from behind. Rush had been leaving a Knights of Columbus meeting in Safety Harbor that night. Yi died the next day, hours before Rush was taken to the Pinellas County Jail.
