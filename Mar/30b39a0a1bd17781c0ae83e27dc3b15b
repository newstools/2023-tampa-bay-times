Beachgoers can hitch a free ride to Clearwater Beach starting today until April 30, courtesy of the city’s annual spring break park-and ride promotion. Any day of the week, drivers can park at the Clearwater City Hall without charge and hop on the Jolley Trolley or Suncoast Beach Trolley to Clearwater Beach. The service, offered by Pinellas County’s transit agency, operates: Monday – Thursday: Every 30 minutes from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday – Sunday: Every 15 minutes from 10 a.m. to midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. The trolley runs until 10 p.m. on Sundays. From city hall, at 112 S Osceola Ave., riders can hop aboard at the Clearwater Beach Transit Center or the Clearwater Beach Marina. Return service to the parking lot boards at the Clearwater Beach Marina, at 25 Causeway Bvld. On the weekend, drivers can also park for free at three other Clearwater locations: 310 Court St., 450 Oak Ave. and 311 S Osceola Ave. The park-and-ride service comes as more than 50,000 cars drive through the Clearwater Beach roundabout on a typical spring break day, the city said in a statement earlier this week.
