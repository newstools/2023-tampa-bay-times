I love college football more than everything but my wife, my son and my dog. And my mom, too — she gets mad when I leave her out. If you’re like me and know that there is no “off” in “offseason,” then I hope you’ll subscribe to the Tampa Bay Times’ newest newsletter, Florida Football Fix, which we’re launching Thursday. My goal is simple: to keep you updated on the greatest, weirdest sport in the world, through a Florida lens. We’ll cover the basics: Are the Gators getting closer, or farther away, from challenging for a championship? Is Florida State ready to make the jump from very good to great? What will Alex Golesh and the proposed stadium do for USF? What are realistic expectations for UCF in the Big 12? Is Mario Cristobal going to get things together this year at Miami? I also want to connect the dots across the country and bring them back here, because what happens in the Pac-12 or Mountain West resonates in Tallahassee and Tampa. Finally, I hope to share some behind-the-scenes stories and insight with you about what’s going on with the state teams and the industry as a whole. We’re publishing once a week during the “offseason” and twice a week during the fall. I can promise you that I will have plenty to say, because this sport is never, ever boring. Which, of course, is why we all love it so much. You can subscribe (for free!) here. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
