TAMPA ― For the second straight year, defensive tackle Vita Vea has agreed to restructure his contract to give the Bucs more savings on the salary cap. The team is expected to save approximately $9 million by converting a large portion of Vea’s $12.5 million base salary for 2023 into a bonus. The agreement was expected to be finalized Friday. The Bucs are slightly more than $49 million over the $224.8 million salary cap they must be compliant with by Wednesday at 4 p.m., according to Overthecap.com. They began that process by releasing several key members of their Super Bowl 55 championship team, including left tackle Donovan Smith, running back Leonard Fournette and tight end Cameron Brate. It’s the second straight year Vea has converted a portion of his base salary to create some cap room after signing a four-year, $71 million contract in January 2022. Other players the Bucs are expected to ask to restructure their recent contracts include cornerback Carlton Davis and receiver Chris Godwin. In addition, the Bucs tendered guard Nick Leverett a one-year qualifying offer as an exclusive rights free agent. He started 10 games for Tampa Bay at left guard last season. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
