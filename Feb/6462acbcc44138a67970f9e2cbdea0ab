ST. PETERSBURG — Just a few months after St. Petersburg artist Chad Mize closed his gallery in Historic Uptown, he’s curating a new venue called Space. It’s in the Warehouse Arts District, on the property of the St. Petersburg Distillery at 855 28th St. S. It was originally a Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority bus depot, so the industrial vibes are heavy and will be left untouched. Mize will curate quarterly group shows at Space. The first one features headliner Bask, whose artwork will fill one room by itself. The show will be up for one weekend only with the opening reception happening March 10 from 7-11 p.m. It’s free to attend. The artist roster is a group of heavy hitters including Bekky Beukes, iBOMS, Tes One, Palehorse, Frank Strunk III, Jenipher Chandley and Mize, to name a few. Mize said it’s always been a dream of his to curate a space this big. He’ll have access to it for at least a year, and wants to help other artists, musicians and filmmakers utilize it. DJ Repete will be playing tunes during the opening reception, with St. Petersburg Distillery providing the cocktail bar and the Shiso Crispy food truck on site. There will be live screen printing by Wove, and the Vitale Bros. will be painting giant metal drums that were sourced from the property during the event. On March 11, Space will be open during the Second Saturday Art Walk from 4-9 p.m. It’ll be open 11 a.m.-4 pm. March 12, featuring readings from poets and writers.
