Golf superstar Tiger Woods will announce on his social media accounts that opening day for his newest golf entertainment center, PopStroke, is Feb. 17 in the Wesley Chapel area. Woods has opened a chain of the high-concept putting courses, with dining and playgrounds, co-owned with Wall Street veteran Greg Bartoli. It will open next week at noon near Cypress Creek Town Center at 25297 Sierra Center Blvd., Lutz. The company has added new Florida locations recently in Orlando, Sarasota and Delray Beach. Unlike the windmills and alligator jaws of old-fashioned putt-putt courses, each location has two 18-hole mini golf courses designed by Woods and his TGR Design team. There are Augusta-like holes created in miniature that incorporate fairways, bunkers and rough as seen on traditional golf courses.
