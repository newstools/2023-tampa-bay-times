Tyler Glasnow, one of the Rays’ starters, sustained an oblique injury while throwing to hitters on Monday at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Disney World. Glasnow will undergo an MRI on Tuesday morning to determine the severity, but he seems certain to miss some time. Based on past oblique injuries involving pitchers, that could be roughly six to eight weeks, which would include the start of the season, with opening day on March 30. An extended absence would obviously be a big blow to the Rays, who are banking on the strength and depth of their starting pitching this season. Yonny Chirinos and Luis Patino would appear the top candidates to replace Glasnow in the rotation. Glasnow was throwing his second live batting practice session of the spring Monday when he stopped after about six pitches and left the mound with an athletic trainer. The 29-year-old returned to action at the end of last season after undergoing Tommy John elbow surgery and installation of a brace following a June 2021 injury. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
