Location(s) Due to extensive damage from Hurricane Ian, the Rays can’t use their training complex in Port Charlotte this spring. Instead, they will split their camp between Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, where the Braves trained from 1997-2019, and Tropicana Field, their regular-season home. The first two weeks will be held at Disney, with morning workouts, usually starting at 9:30. They will shift their base to the Trop starting March 1 and play 13 games there (for tickets, see raysbaseball.com), while also using the nearby Huggins-Stengel complex for workouts. Minor-league camp will continue at Disney through March.
