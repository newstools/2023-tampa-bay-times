A pair of investment firms have teamed up to purchase an office building in Tampa’s Westshore district for $40 million. The Bridgeport Center, whose tenants include Delta Air Lines and the United Way Suncoast, has sold to a joint venture between South Florida private equity firm MHCommercial Real Estate Fund II and New York investment firm Siguler Guff & Co. The 180,247-square-foot building sits at 5201 W Kennedy Blvd, across the street from WestShore Plaza, just east of the Howard Frankland Bridge. Its past tenants included the Tampa office of Sen. Marco Rubio. “While office utilization is undergoing a secular transformation, this investment represents a first-class property with a strong record of tenant retention in a post-COVID world that is bolstered by its position within a fundamentally sound market,” Siguler Guff vice president Adam Domanico said in a statement. The Bridgeport Center’s new owners said they plan to add suites built on spec and make other property upgrades.
