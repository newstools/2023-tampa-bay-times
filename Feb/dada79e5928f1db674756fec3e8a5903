TAMPA — Lightning defenseman Ian Cole was fined $5,000 for kneeing Avalanche forward Andrew Cogliano during the first period of Thursday’s 5-0 win at Amalie Arena. The fine is the largest allowed by the league’s collective bargaining agreement. The money will go to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund. Cole’s hit, which occurred during a collision with Cogliano near the side boards 1:50 into the game, dropped Cogliano to the ice for several moments. No penalty was called on the play. Cole was pinching in the Lightning offensive zone when he ran into Cogliano, who spun, lost his stick and fell to the ice. He hobbled off with the help of an athletic trainer and headed down the tunnel toward the Colorado locker room. He returned to the game a few minutes later. The game between opponents from last season’s Stanley Cup final was physical and included two fights. Ross Colton dropped the gloves with Logan O’Connor in the final minute of the first period. After having words with each other throughout the game, Pat Maroon fought Kurtis MacDermid with 8.5 seconds left. • • • Sign up for Lightning Strikes, a weekly newsletter from Bolts beat writer Eduardo A.
