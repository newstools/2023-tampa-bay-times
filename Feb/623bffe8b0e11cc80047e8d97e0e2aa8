After seven years at the helm of the St. Petersburg Area Economic Development Corp., J.P. DuBuque is moving on. The economic development group’s CEO and founding president will step down from his post in April to become chief operating officer of Tampa accounting firm Rivero, Gordimer & Co., the organization announced Friday afternoon. “I am so proud of what we’ve built at the St. Pete EDC,” DuBuque said in a statement. “I have loved working with companies to educate them about the business benefits of our area and connecting them to the people and programs they need to be successful here. In my new role I look forward to using the experience I’ve had working with companies at different stages in their life cycles in various industries and focusing it on one company to help it excel over the long term.” DuBuque was the group’s first president when it began in 2016 as a public-private partnership to entice companies to relocate and expand in St. Petersburg. Since then, the EDC has touted more than 2,100 new jobs in what it has identified as target industries. “The St. Pete EDC has been a valuable partner in promoting the Sunshine City to out-of-market companies considering relocation or expansion, and J.P. has been an important link between the city, the business community, and prospective businesses,” Mayor Ken Welch said in a statement. The St. Pete EDC has begun the process of searching for a new CEO, with the St. Petersburg Area Chamber of Commerce expected to lend a hand once DuBuque leaves on April 28. The organization is also developing a three- to five-year growth strategy that it expects to unveil soon. In a statement, Rivero, Gordimer & Co. managing partner Herman Lazzara praised DuBuque’s “entrepreneurial and collaborative approach.” “With his personal value set so aligned with our corporate values, we know that J.P. will enhance our ability to grow our team to drive impact for both our valued clients and our community,” Lazzara said.
