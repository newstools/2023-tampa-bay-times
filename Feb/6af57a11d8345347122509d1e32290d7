St. Petersburg’s Fourth Street North was looking a little bare for a few days with the absence of Sunken Gardens’ iconic sign, but no longer: The attraction’s new sign is officially up. The roadside attraction at 1825 Fourth St. N has replaced its sign with one that more closely resembles the original flower-filled sign from the 1960s. That sign was built by the late Manton Giles and the venerable Ace Neon sign company. A newer, similar sign with bright blue 40-inch letters was installed in March 2003. It used the original poles that have held up the sign since the ‘60s. The original poles were in need of replacement, so the city agreed to use the opportunity to update the sign with neon and LED lights. Sunken Gardens’ historic status allows it to have a sign that size, but most businesses around St. Petersburg have to adhere to more modest signage requirements.
