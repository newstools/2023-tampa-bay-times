Popular Tampa-based coffee roaster and beer brewer King State’s empire is expanding to downtown St. Petersburg. Adam Massey, who is a barback at the Tampa location, confirmed the expansion across the bay. The new King State location will be in the forthcoming COHatch, a St. Petersburg offshoot of the Tampa coworking space coming to 15 Eighth St. Founded by brothers-in-law Nate Young and Tim McTague, King State opened on Floribraska Avenue in 2019. In addition to craft coffee and beer, the spot has a food menu and full liquor bar. Young is an original member of Anberlin, an alternative/emo group from Florida; McTague toured with Tampa-based metalcore group Underoath. The idea for King State came from the type of spots they’d frequent while touring with their bands. King State already has a presence in St. Petersburg with The Brutalist brewing facility and its taproom, Temple of Beer, at 1776 11th Ave. N. On March 9, King State will hold Lager Fest at The Brutalist. Get tickets at shop.king-state.com.
