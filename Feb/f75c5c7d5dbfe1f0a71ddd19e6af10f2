For local fans who have become wary of fly-by-night spring football leagues, the refurbished XFL — which begins play this weekend — offers a few dozen reasons to initially tune in. The rosters are teeming with former standouts from state universities, as well as some former bay area prep stars. Additionally, former Bucs tight end Anthony Becht coaches the St. Louis franchise, and former FSU cornerback Terrell Buckley — the 1991 Jim Thorpe Award winner — coaches the Orlando team. Here’s a breakdown of those with local or state-college ties on each of the league’s eight rosters: Arlington Renegades DB Jamal Carter, Miami DB Rannell Hall, UCF DL Bruce Hector, USF/Robinson High DB Will Hill, Florida RB Adrian Killins, UCF DB Cre’Von LeBlanc, Florida Atlantic LB Donald Payne, Stetson D.C.
