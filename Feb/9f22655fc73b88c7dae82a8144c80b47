A Virginia cybersecurity firm has opened a Tampa office with plans to add dozens of jobs this decade. Ridgeline International, which specializes in government contracting, will lease space at 4010 W. Boy Scout Blvd., the Tampa Bay Economic Development Council said Thursday. The company plans to employ 30 workers there in the next few years. In a statement, Erik Wittreich, the firm’s chief executive officer, pointed to Tampa Bay’s military community around MacDill Air Force Base and U.S. Southern Command as a reason for the expansion. “Operating out of Tampa will afford us access to an impressive talent pool, and one that is ideal as Ridgeline continues our targeted growth,” Wittreich said. The company was scheduled to hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony at its Tampa office on Friday, with Tampa Mayor Jane Castor scheduled to attend. “Tampa has a long and proud history as a military-friendly business community and a best place for veterans to live,” Castor said in a statement.
