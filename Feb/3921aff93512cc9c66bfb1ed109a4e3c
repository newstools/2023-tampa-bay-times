Troopers are looking for the driver of a vehicle who hit and killed a pedestrian Saturday evening on U.S. 92 in Hillsborough County. The crash happened around 7:20 p.m. west of Pasadena Drive in Seffner, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The vehicle, believed to be a small van or pickup truck, was heading west on U.S. 92 and struck a 61-year-old man walking along the highway shoulder, troopers said. The victim was from Plant City, according to a news release. After the crash, the driver continued westbound on U.S. 92. The vehicle is thought to have damage to the right headlamp and side mirror. Anyone with information about the crash was asked to contact the Highway Patrol by calling *FHP or **TIPS, troopers said Sunday morning. The crash comes less than a day after another fatal hit-and-run along U.S. 92 in east Hillsborough County. A little after 3 a.m. Saturday, a driver hit two people, killing one, west of the intersection of Charlie Taylor Road, east of Plant City. The car, described as a dark sedan, was heading east and struck two people as they tried to cross the highway from the south, troopers said. A 40-year-old man was killed and a 28-year-old man was seriously injured. About one quarter of all traffic crashes are deemed hit-and-run cases, the Tampa Bay Times previously reported.
