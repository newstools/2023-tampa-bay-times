Midtown Tampa is officially out of space at one of its office buildings. Real estate firm Greystar has signed a 6,150-square-foot lease at the Loft office building, developers the Bromley Cos. announced Wednesday. The lease means the 70,000-square-foot Loft is fully leased out, and Midtown’s offices as a whole are 98% full. “Since the opening of The Loft at Midtown Tampa in January 2021, we have received incredible feedback and interest from the market and are thrilled to have met the milestone of a 100% leased building,” Bromley CEO Nicholas Haines said in a statement. The Loft, which has retail space on the first floor and boutique-style workspaces on the second, is also home to architecture firm Gresham Smith, real estate company Compass and construction firm Kast. Greystar has, in some ways, been part of the $1 billion mixed-use development for some time. The Charleston, S.C.-based company manages Novel, Midtown’s 390-unit residential building located above Whole Foods and other retail stores. “We are no strangers to the incredible Midtown Tampa development,” Lewis Stoneburner, Greystar’s managing director of Florida development and construction, said in a statement. “The Loft represents the best-in-class office space the Tampa market has to offer, and its top-tier roster of tenants — all within the real estate community — proves that. We couldn’t be more excited to make Midtown Tampa our official home for our Tampa employees.” While Midtown’s currently available office space is almost entirely leased out, that won’t be the case for very long. Bromley and Highwoods Properties recently broke ground on Midtown East, a 430,000-square-foot office tower slated to open in 2025. The companies have already sold 11 stories and nearly 300,000 square feet to Tampa Electric Co. and Peoples Gas, which announced in December it was moving its headquarters there from downtown Tampa.
