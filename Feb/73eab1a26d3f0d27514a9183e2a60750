A teacher’s aide at Freedom High School has been arrested after she had sex with a 16-year-old student, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office reported on Tuesday. Briona Inman, 24, was arrested on a charge of soliciting or engaging in sexual conduct with a student by an authority figure, the sheriff’s office announced in a news release. School officials fired Inman after the allegations arose, according to a schools spokesperson. Sheriff’s officials said Inman befriended the student at the school, then brought him to her home and had sex with him. The sheriff’s office was notified of the allegations on Monday and launched an investigation. “We are shocked and deeply troubled by these charges,” Hillsborough County Public Schools said in a statement. “This individual had only been working in the district since August of this school year. After being made aware of the allegations and the subsequent arrest, we took immediate action and have terminated her from her employment. The safety and well-being of our students is our top priority.” Bail information was not immediately available.
