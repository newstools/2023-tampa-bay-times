When Barnes & Noble opens a new South Tampa bookstore Wednesday, Tampa’s most famous author will be there to cut the ribbon. Michael Connelly will sign his latest novel, “Desert Star,” after the 10 a.m. opening of the store at 128 S West Shore Blvd., Suite 100, in Town Square Center in Tampa. That’s less than 2 miles from the recently shuttered Barnes & Noble store on North Dale Mabry Highway, which sold books to local readers for 29 years, according to a news release from Barnes & Noble. Becky Boldizar, manager of the new store, says she’s happy to have Connelly kick it off. “Our author promotions team reached out,” she said by phone. “He was one of the top ones on our list.” Boldizar says she’s “super excited to open one of our new-concept stores,” a 10,000-square-foot design that’s “completely different from the traditional one.” Connelly, who has homes in Tampa and Los Angeles, has sold more than 80 million books worldwide. His series of novels about Harry Bosch, a Los Angeles detective, have been the source for two Amazon streaming TV series, “Bosch” and “Bosch: Legacy,” and his books about attorney Mickey Haller are the source for a Netflix series, “The Lincoln Lawyer.” “Desert Star,” published in 2022, features Bosch and LAPD Detective Renée Ballard on the trail of a multiple killer.
