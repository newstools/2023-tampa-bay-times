Crews from multiple agencies worked together to battle a brush fire at the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office training facility in Lithia on Friday, according to Hillsborough County Fire Rescue. The agency said in an afternoon news release that the fire, which spread across about 50 acres, was nearly contained and the focus was on hotspots. In addition to 20 Fire Rescue units and dozens of their firefighters, members of the Florida Forest Service and aviation units from the Sheriff’s Office and Tampa Police Department helped extinguish the flames, providing both manpower and equipment. Firefighters had to contend with “dry conditions, tall grass, topography, and brisk winds” as they battled the blaze for about three hours, the release said. No one was injured and no structures were damaged, Fire Rescue said. The cause of the fire is under investigation.
