As Florida’s most densely populated county, Pinellas puts a premium on residential land. Townhomes and condos are proliferating because land is so expensive; houses rarely occupy more than a single lot. That’s what makes a house in North Pinellas all the more unusual. An impressive 4,424 square feet itself, the house sits on nearly 13 acres and is almost totally surrounded by the 8,700-acre Brooker Creek Preserve, the county’s largest natural reserve. The view in every direction is nothing but sky, trees, grass and water. “The land is really gorgeous,” says Christina Paolillo, the listing agent. “It’s very unique and right in our backyard, but you’d never know it.” Priced at $6.25 million, the house was built in 2012 with four bedrooms, 3 ½ bathrooms and a three-car garage. Natural light floods the living room with its floor-to-ceiling windows, exposed wood beams and wood-burning fireplace. The kitchen has recessed cabinets, a six-burner Wolf stove with griddle, pot filler, built-in Miele refrigerator and freezer, two dishwashers, an instant hot faucet and walk-in pantry. An oversized island opens to the living room and dining area. The master suite, floored in marble, features walk-in closets and a bathroom with a soaking tub, dual sinks and vanities and a glass rainfall shower. Two other bedrooms and a bathroom are opposite the master suite, with stairs leading to an expanded loft, fourth bedroom, a full bathroom and a bonus space. Outside is a patio with fireplace and kitchenette. A seven-stall stable includes a hay room, a shavings room and a tack room. About 15 minutes east of Tarpon Springs, the house is on Ranch Road, which runs off Keystone Road. Somewhat surprisingly for a property in this price range, there is no swimming pool. Not to worry. There’s plenty of room to put one in.
