The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office arrested nine people during a crackdown on street racing Saturday. During the nine-hour operation, deputies conducted 158 traffic stops, issued 60 citations and 114 warnings. They also impounded seven cars, five of which will be detained for 30 days, and took possession of five guns, a bulletproof vest and “a large amount of ammunition,” according to a sheriff’s office news release. Those arrested were taken into custody for participating in a street racing takeover, deputies said. The goal of the operation was to discourage locals from participating in street racing, as well as those who travel from outside of the county. “Drivers who participate in these events are often driving at excessive speeds, which could easily result in a loss of control leading to an injury or a fatality,” Hillsborough Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news release. “Those who choose to attend these events often overlook the potential risks, not realizing that as a bystander they are also in danger. ”
