The Times Editorial Board has now published all of its recommendations in the Tampa elections. Not everyone thinks that a newspaper’s editorial board should make political recommendations. There are valid arguments on both sides of that debate. We believe the recommendations contribute to healthy political dialogue. And given how many readers ask when the recommendations will appear, a lot of you find them valuable. You don’t have to agree with us, but be assured that we take the process seriously. Election day is March 7. Need information on how to register or request a mail ballot? Go to VoteHillsborough.gov. The link for each race is clickable.
