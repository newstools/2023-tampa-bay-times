The Topgolf Live tour is coming to Raymond James Stadium, allowing golfers to shank a golf ball from the upper levels of the stadium to targets on the field below. The four-day event will run May 4-7, and tickets will go on sale starting 10 a.m. Friday at topgolflive.com and ticketmaster.com. “Players will hit golf balls at on-field targets placed between 40 and 120 yards from the tee box. Utilizing Toptracer technology, each shot is traced and instantly scored,” a news release from the Tampa Sports Authority said. “Players will tee off from the south plaza of the stadium and take aim at targets staged throughout the field.” Tee times are reserved in one-hour increments. Prices start at $60 per person for a bay of six people. VIP tickets start at $165 and include two drink tickets, one Topgolf Lifetime Membership, one Topgolf Live black clover hat, $10 off a Topgolf Gameplay Card, and a behind-the-scenes tour of Raymond James Stadium including the Bucs locker room and the stadium’s famous pirate ship. Special safety protocols will be implemented, the announcement said, including disinfecting golf clubs, tables and hitting bays between tee times, plus washing golf balls after play and before they’re used again.
