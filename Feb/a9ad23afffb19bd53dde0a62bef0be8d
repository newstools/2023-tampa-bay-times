Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Richard Martin as the newest judge on the Hillsborough County Court, according to a press release from the governor’s office. Martin  will fill the vacancy created by the appointment of former judge Susan Lopez last August as the state attorney for the 13th Circuit. Lopez was appointed to the office after DeSantis suspended  Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren last year, claiming he had blanket policies against prosecuting certain types of cases Warren sued DeSantis, and in January U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle ruled the governor violated the First Amendment and the Florida Constitution when he suspended Warren. “The allegation was false,” U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle wrote in a ruling issued in January. “Mr. Warren’s well-established policy, followed in every case by every prosecutor in the office, was to exercise prosecutorial discretion at every stage of every case. Any reasonable investigation would have confirmed this.” But Hinkle said he did not have the authority to return Warren to office.. Prior to his appointment, Martin had served as the chief of staff for the Florida attorney general since 2020. He also worked as the general counsel in the Florida Office of the Attorney General from January 2019 through April 2020, according to his LinkedIn profile. Martin also spent more than 14 years working in the Tampa office for the Miami-based Ackerman LLC law firm before his move to the attorney general’s office in Tallahassee, according to his LinkedIn profile. Martin earned his bachelor’s degree at the University of Florida and received his law degree from Florida State University.
