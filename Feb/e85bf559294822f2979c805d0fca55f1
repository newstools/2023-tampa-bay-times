Facing “historic inflation,” Tampa International Airport officials are increasing parking rates. The maximum daily rate for economy parking will rise $2 on April 4, for a total cost of $14 for 24 hours of parking. Hourly rates will not be affected. Parking facility operations costs over the next 12 years are estimated to be $72 million, the airport said in an announcement Tuesday. Per unit labor costs have increased 14% since before the pandemic. In response to rising costs, the Hillsborough County Aviation Authority Board of Directors earlier this month also approved a future parking rate adjustment for when current construction projects are completed. These include moving walkways in the long-term parking garage and demolishing the an “outdated monorail” in long- and short-term garages. These improvements will provide almost 500 new parking spaces across both garages when complete. The projects are expected to be finished next year at a cost of $30.4 million, part of the airport’s capital improvement program. When the rate adjustment takes effect, daily maximum parking fees will be $28 in the short-term garage, $22 in the long-term garage and $18 in the economy garage. In 2021, the airport launched online booking site park.tampaairport.com, where travelers can find cheaper rates and reserve a parking space up to a year in advance. The last time the aviation board approved a rate adjustment at Tampa airport’s parking facilities was in 2020.
