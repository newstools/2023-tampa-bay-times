A 38-year-old Lutz woman was killed Sunday night when the driver of an SUV struck her as she tried to cross a Wesley Chapel road, troopers said. The woman was walking along the east shoulder of Wesley Chapel Boulevard north of Hyde Park Boulevard around 7:20 p.m. and then tried to cross the highway, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The driver of a Toyota RAV4 heading north on Wesley Chapel Boulevard struck the woman, troopers said. The woman died at the scene of the crash. The Toyota driver, a 61-year-old Land O’ Lakes woman, was not injured. The Florida Highway Patrol typically does not release the names of people involved in crashes due to Marsy’s Law.
