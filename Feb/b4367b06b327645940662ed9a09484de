Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik, who spearheaded the transformation of Tampa’s Water Street, now owns one of the most exclusive residences in the neighborhood: a record-breaking $8.34 million condo at the Tampa Edition. Vinik and his wife Penny purchased the penthouse at 1000 Water Street last week, according to records from the Hillsborough County Clerk’s office. It is the most expensive condo ever sold in the Tampa Bay area. That record was previously held by a different unit in the same building which sold for just under $8 million in July. The Edition, Tampa’s first five-star hotel, opened in October. There are only 38 residences in the condo portion and all of them have been sold according to Smith & Associates Real Estate, the brokerage handling listings at the property. Vinik’s unit takes up the entire top floor of the 26-story building. Condo residents have access to all the hotel’s amenities including the spa, the rooftop pool and the terrace. There is also a residents-only gym, social kitchen and lounge, and an “on-premises lifestyle manager,” according to the building’s website. Vinik could not immediately be reached for comment.
