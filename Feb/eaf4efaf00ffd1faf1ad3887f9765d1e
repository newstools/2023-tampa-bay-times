Adventure Island, the water park across the street from Busch Gardens in Tampa, opens for the season March 4 and has announced that later in March it will add Shaka-Laka Shores, a splash zone for toddlers near the front of the park. ”The newest addition will have more than two dozen playful elements, a variety of interactive aquatic components, all within a zero-depth area — ideal for smaller kids — as well as additional shaded areas,” said a park news release. Shaka-Laka Shores will feature an area with 25 individual elements and will greet guests as they enter the park. The splash zone, along with recently opened attractions Rapids Racer and Wahoo Remix, is part of the waterpark’s largest expansion in more than 30 years. The park is open on weekends only in March, with the exception of the week of March 13, which is spring break for all Tampa Bay public school systems and the University of South Florida.
