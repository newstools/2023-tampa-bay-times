The Bucs, 7-5 at the time, won’t lose another game in the 2020 season.

Oct. 3, 2021: In his de facto homecoming hyped as the biggest regular-season game in NFL history, Brady directs a field-goal drive in the waning minutes to lift the Bucs to a 19-17 win over the Patriots in Foxborough, Massachusetts. He also eclipses Drew Brees’ NFL career record for regular season passing yardage (80,358). Oct. 24, 2021: Brady throws his 600th career touchdown pass, to Mike Evans.

Oct. 28, 2022: In separate social media posts, Brady and Gisele Bundchen announce they’ve ended their marriage after 13 years.

Nov. 6, 2022: Brady’s fourth-quarter screen pass to Leonard Fournette against the Rams puts him past 100,000 career NFL passing yards (regular season and playoffs), making him the first pro athlete in a major sport (football, basketball, baseball, hockey) to hit a six-figure statistic. Dec. 25, 2022: Brady engineers the 46th — and final — fourth-quarter comeback of his career, rallying the Bucs from a 10-point fourth-period deficit for a 19-16 overtime triumph against the Cardinals in Glendale, Arizona.
