The city of Tampa will once again dye the Hillsborough River a deep shade of emerald for St. Patrick’s Day weekend. This year’s River O’Green Fest will be held Saturday, March 18, the day after St. Patrick’s Day, with a party at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park with live music, kids’ activities, food trucks and, of course, beer. For two years, in 2020 and 2021, the River O’Green Fest was canceled as the pandemic hit Florida. The annual tradition started in 2012 when Bob Buckhorn was mayor. Crews will dye the river kelly green between the Cass Street Bridge and Kennedy Bridge. The dye is potable water grade, nontoxic and biodegradable. It’s used primarily by plumbers to trace leaks and in search-and-rescue efforts in large bodies of water. “We’re so excited to work with the city and Grow Financial again to bring this Irish-themed celebration to our residents and visitors,” said Tampa Downtown Partnership President and CEO Lynda Remund. “I love seeing the hundreds of people who come downtown, decked out in green gear, for a day full of food and fun. It’s a great way to support our local businesses and bask in the beauty of this incredible city.” At 11 a.m. that day, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor will sound the horn to start the process of dyeing the Hillsborough River green. The dye is certified to meet National Sanitation Foundation Standard 60 for use in and around drinking water. “Seeing our Hillsborough River turn emerald green in celebration of St. Patrick’s Day is a great reminder of the excitement and fun that Tampa has to offer,” added Mayor Jane Castor. “I know how much I look forward to this annual tradition and the opportunity it brings to come together and celebrate all that makes our city great.” The River O’Green Fest will run from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on March 18 and it’s free entry at the park at 600 Ashley Drive in downtown Tampa.
