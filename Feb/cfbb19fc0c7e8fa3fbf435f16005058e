St. Petersburg is already rich with murals, and now a selection of them are embedded with virtual performances in music, drama, poetry, song, dance and meditation by local artists. Presented by the St. Petersburg Arts Alliance, the project called Murals in Mind launched today. Twelve Shine festival murals were selected to activate with virtual performance videos. Viewers can visit the murals and access the videos (created by Sunsation Media) through the Pixelstix app on their smartphone, or watch the videos remotely. The concept behind the project is that art can heal and promote wellness. The alliance worked with Paige Dickenson, a psychologist trained in trauma and art therapy who works at Eckerd College. Murals in Mind is supported by the Community Foundation of Tampa Bay and the Love IV Lawrence foundation. “This project was conceived through the passion and understanding of the power of art to heal,” Terry Marks, the alliance’s CEO said in a news release. “As our community continues to rise after so many challenges, it is evident how much we all have endured. The way to lift spirits from loneliness, depression, anxiety and stress is to continue to utilize art as a healing tool. Murals, music, dance, drama and poetry communicate and lift our outlook towards hope and happiness. That is the core of Murals in Mind, our valentine to our friends and neighbors and to the city we love.” To see a map and to access videos, visit stpeteartsalliance.org/muralsinmind.
