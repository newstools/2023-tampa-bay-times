A man driving a sedan struck and killed a pedestrian near St Pete-Clearwater International Airport in northern Pinellas County on Saturday night. The driver, a 52-year-old man from Holiday, was traveling northbound on 34th Street North when he turned left at Ulmerton Road and hit a man walking southbound across the highway at 9:40 p.m., according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The victim, 38, from New York City, was transported to a hospital, where he died. At least seven other people have been killed in crashes in Pinellas County since the start of the year, according to preliminary data from the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles published earlier this month. The death toll includes a 39-year-old man who was hit by an SUV while riding an electric bicycle at a St. Petersburg intersection and a 79-year-old woman who was being helped across the street in a downtown Dunedin crosswalk when a person driving a pickup truck struck her.
