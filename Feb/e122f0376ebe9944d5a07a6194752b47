If you need to travel south across Tampa Bay late Monday, the Howard Frankland Bridge wonâ€™t be an option. All southbound lanes of Interstate 275 are planned to close from 11 p.m. Monday until 5 a.m. Tuesday, according to the Florida Department of Transportation. The agency said the closure will allow crews to install sign structures across all traffic lanes on the Pinellas County side of the bridge. Traffic will be blocked on I-275 west of State Road 60 in Tampa until Ulmerton Road in Pinellas. Traffic will be diverted onto the Courtney Campbell Causeway and Gandy Bridge. Transportation officials encourage drivers to plan for extra travel time during the closure. Northbound traffic on the Howard Frankland will remain open.
