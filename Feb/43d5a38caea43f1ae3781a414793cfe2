A $23.9 million waterfront home has just been listed in Tampa’s coveted Davis Islands neighborhood. Coming in at 1.45 acres with 464 feet of water frontage, the property at 42 Ladoga Ave. has more land than Derek Jeter’s former home, which sold for a record-breaking $22.5 million in 2021. The home itself is 9,038 square feet and was originally built in 1928. There are seven bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a gym, a wine cellar and two office spaces. Outdoors, you’ll find a pool and a boathouse with two lifts. It sits on three buildable lots, all of which have direct water access to the bay. This leaves the opportunity for the home to be torn down and redeveloped into three separate properties. The listing agents are Mary Beth Byrd, Leslie Minder and Dina Sierra Smith with Smith & Associates Real Estate. “With the influx of out-of-state buyers flooding our market who are accustomed to price points well above what Tampa has produced, obtaining a significant piece of Tampa Bay’s waterfront like this is nothing less than a rarified opportunity,” Byrd said in a statement.
