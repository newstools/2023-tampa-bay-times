A Pinellas detention deputy was arrested Tuesday on a battery charge in Hillsborough County, jail records show. Hillsborough deputies say Corlis Moore, 38, got into an argument with her partner that turned physical. Moore threw a plastic water bottle at her partner, which hit her partner in the face, according to an arrest affidavit. The arrest affidavit states Moore also threw a kitchen chair in her partner’s direction during the argument, and also scratched her partner’s face and arm. During the argument, she shouted that she would “kill” her partner and that she was “a deputy,” the arrest affidavit states. A Pinellas County Sheriff’s spokesperson said Moore remains on active duty, but is under an open internal affairs investigation. She was hired in January 2011.
