A woman was killed Tuesday morning after she was hit by a pickup after the driver turned into the driveway of a CVS to avoid a crash with another vehicle, the Florida Highway Patrol reported. The incident occurred at 10:35 a.m. in the area of Moog Road west of U.S. 19, the Highway Patrol said. A 47-year-old woman from New Port Richey was driving a 2006 GMC pickup east on Moog Road when another driver leaving a 7-Eleven parking turned in front of her. The driver of the pickup steered north to avoid a collision and turned into the CVS driveway, where the truck struck the pedestrian, troopers said. The pedestrian, a 70-year-old woman from Holiday, was taken to the hospital, where she died. The driver of the pickup was taken to a hospital with injuries that troopers said were not life threatening. The pickup she was driving had hit a power pole before coming to a stop, troopers said. No information about the vehicle that turned in front of the pickup was released, nor were the names of any of the people involved.
