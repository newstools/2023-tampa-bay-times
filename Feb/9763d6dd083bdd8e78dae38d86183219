TAMPA — Tampa’s police union has endorsed political novice Blake Casper over incumbent Bill Carlson in their battle for a South Tampa City Council seat in the March 7 city election. The union also picked Gwendolyn Henderson over retired Tampa police officer Orlando Gudes. And the union passed over current council members Lynn Hurtak and Joseph Citro in favor of fresh faces. The union’s selections were obtained late Wednesday night by the Tampa Bay Times. Carlson has clashed with police leadership, namely former police chief Brian Dugan, who dubbed Carlson “Bullet Bill” for the council member’s opposition to the purchase of training ammunition for the police department during the 2020 summer protests following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The union also selected Alan Clendenin over Joseph Citro in the citywide District 1 race and former state Sen. Janet Cruz over Lynn Hurtak in another citywide seat, District 3. Hurtak, who was appointed to the council in April, had her own crossed wires with the Police Department soon after she was appointed in April to the seat left vacant by John Dingfelder’s resignation. The Police Benevolent Association is also backing Henderson over Gudes, who retired from the department after a long career. Guido Maniscalco was selected over Mike Suarez in the citywide District 2 race. And Charlie Miranda received the endorsement in the West Tampa-centered District 6 contest. The union also endorsed Luis Viera, who was reelected without an opponent last month. This is a developing story. Check tampabay.com for updates.
