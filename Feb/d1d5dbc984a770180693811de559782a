The Hernando County Sheriff’s Office is seeking volunteers to help find a 2-year-old who went missing in northern Brooksville Thursday morning. The Sheriff’s Office posted instructions to its Facebook page Friday morning for anyone looking to help search for Joshua “JJ” Rowland, 2. The boy is believed to have left a home in the area of Cheever Road and Yontz Road while his parent was asleep. The home is in northern Brooksville in an area deputies described as rural. Those interested in searching for the boy are asked to report to the “convenience store at the corner of Cobb Road and Fort Dade Avenue” after 8:15 a.m. Deputies ask that volunteers bring a valid driver’s license or identification card. Sheriff’s Office employees will be at the site to conduct a brief background check on any potential volunteers, the post said. Once approved, volunteers will be given a tag and additional instructions. The Sheriff’s Office advised volunteers to wear appropriate clothes and shoes to walk through heavily wooded areas. Volunteers should bring water or Gatorade to stay hydrated. The 2-year-old was last seen wearing a gray Batman shirt and dark pajama pants with tools on them. He has curly blond hair and law enforcement said he “may have a swollen lip.” “As of right now we have no indication that he was abducted or he wandered off,” Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis said in a 5 p.m. news conference Thursday. “We just don’t know what happened.” In an updated news release sent at 8:37 p.m. Thursday, Hernando officials said the ground search had ended for the night and would resume Friday morning. However, they said, the aviation unit from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office would continue its search of the area for a few more hours.
