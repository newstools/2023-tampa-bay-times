TAMPA — Busch Gardens has announced that Feb. 27 will be the opening day for its new “screaming swing” attraction that will fling riders high into the air. Pass Members will be among the first to experience exclusive ride time on Serengeti Flyer on Feb. 24, the park said in an announcement. The new pendulum ride adds to the park’s already deep supply of 10 thrill rides, the most of any theme park in Florida. The Serengeti Flyer has twin dueling arms that progressively sway back and forth, reaching speeds of 68 miles per hour and a 135-foot height at its peak. The ride will levitate guests out of their seats with each swing as their legs dangle while they soar, reaching multiple negative-G moments before plunging back toward the ground. Riders will be seated back-to-back in rows of 10 across two gondolas, allowing for 40 guests to experience the ride at once.
