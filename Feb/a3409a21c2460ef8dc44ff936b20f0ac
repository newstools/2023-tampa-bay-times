The Chevrolet spun, hit the barrier wall and caught on fire, the statement said. Hoffman’s car rotated across the lanes and hit a Ford SUV, the highway patrol said. A 41-year-old Tampa man sitting in the Chevrolet’s passenger seat died at the scene, while the driver in that vehicle had minor injuries, the statement said. The Florida Highway Patrol arrested Hoffman and charged him with DUI, DUI property damage, DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide, the statement said.
