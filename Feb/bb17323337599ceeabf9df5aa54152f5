A 40-year-old woman has been arrested after police say she tried to teach her 9-year-old how to back out of a parking spot and the child crashed into a building in New Port Richey. Officers were called to the scene of a vehicle crash at 6335 Grand Blvd. shortly before 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, the New Port Richey Police Department said Thursday. Video surveillance provided by the agency shows a woman identified as Amy Lee Kid standing outside the vehicle, speaking to her child through the open driver’s side window, before the vehicle is put into reverse and the child quickly accelerates — briefly dragging Kid before slamming into the building. The 9-year-old was not injured in the crash, police said, but the building sustained what they describe as “substantial damage.” Investigators say Kid “admitted to trying to teach her child how to back up due to the confined parking situation.” She was arrested and faces charges of child neglect and allowing an unauthorized person to drive a vehicle, police said.
