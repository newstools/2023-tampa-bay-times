Kirstie Alley’s former home in Clearwater is now on the market for $5.95 million following the “Cheers” actress’s death in December. The listing agent, Ray Cassano of Station Square Realty LLC, said the home is already under contract. The 7,815-square-foot house at 1100 N Osceola Ave. overlooks Clearwater Harbor. It has nine bedrooms and 9.5 bathrooms as well as a media room, a formal dining room, two courtyards, three balconies and a pool complete with a spa. The home was previously owned by the late singer Lisa Marie Presley. Alley purchased the property from her in 2000 for $1.5 million. Pinellas County property records show the home is currently owned by Alley’s trust.
