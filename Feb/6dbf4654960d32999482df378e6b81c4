FORT MYERS — The Rays play the first of their 30 spring exhibitions today, as they visit the Twins for the first of back-to-back games in Fort Myers. Though several of the Rays’ projected regulars are in the lineup, most of the focus will be on the execution and enforcement of the new rules, specifically the pitch clock, which forces pitchers and batters to move more quickly. Two games were played Friday in Arizona, and both were done in about 2 1/2 hours. Rays manager Kevin Cash said Saturday, “who wouldn’t sign up for a quicker spring training game?” Cooper Criswell will start for the Rays, with Josh Fleming, Rule 5 pick Kevin Kelly and touted prospect Mason Montgomery among those slated to pitch. Here is the Rays lineup, with Harold Ramirez getting some reps at first base, where he may play occasionally this year: And for the Twins: On deck Sunday: at Red Sox (Fort Myers), 1:05-W.
