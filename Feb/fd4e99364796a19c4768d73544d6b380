A personal injury lawyer accused of stealing more than $840,000 from clients was arrested Monday by the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri announced in a press conference. Christopher Michael Reynolds, 44, opened his private practice in Seminole in 2015 and primarily represented clients injured in vehicle crashes. According to Gualtieri, at least 16 clients settled their cases, then had their money stolen by Reynolds.  Reynolds pocketed as much as $148,750 from one client in March 2019, according to information provided by the Sheriff’s Office. He took at least $100,000 each from multiple clients. The clients whose settlement money was stolen all were left to pay their medical bills themselves, Gualtieri said. He said the Sheriff’s Office believes there likely are more clients whose money was stolen by Reynolds.  Reynolds was booked into Pinellas County Jail  Monday morning. Asked if Reynolds was cooperating with deputies, Gualtieri said Reynolds “lawyered up” upon his arrest.
