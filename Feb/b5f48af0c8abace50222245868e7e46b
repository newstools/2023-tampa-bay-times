The Guinness World Records-certified “world’s largest bounce house” is set to inflate March 10-12 at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa. The Big Bounce America tour travels around the world and brings four massive inflatable attractions: a 16,000-square-foot World’s Largest Bounce House; the newly added Sport Slam, featuring a customized sports arena; an obstacle course more than 900 feet long named The Giant; and a space-themed wonderland called airSPACE. The bounce house even turns into a dance floor with lights and a DJ. There are toddler sessions for age 3 and younger ($22), junior sessions for age 7 and younger ($35), bigger kids sessions for age 15 and younger ($35) and adults-only sessions ($41) for age 16 and older. All-Access Tickets are available online and include a three-hour pass to the event and unlimited access to Sport Slam, The Giant and airSPACE.
