USF’s first football season under coach Alex Golesh begins with a trip to Western Kentucky, includes a home game against mighty Alabama and ends with a matchup against new American Athletic Conference member Charlotte. Though non-conference matchups were previously known, the Bulls’ full schedule became official with Tuesday’s announcement from the AAC. USF will play four of the incoming AAC members: Charlotte, Florida Atlantic, Texas San Antonio and Alabama Birmingham. The Owls are USF’s new annual conference opponent. The Bulls’ schedule does not include a game against War on I-4 rival UCF. The Knights are moving to the Big 12, and the schools were not able to quickly arrange a non-conference matchup (though they have said they are open to doing so in the future). USF’s marquee opponent will be Sept. 16 against Nick Saban’s Crimson Tide. Alabama last played at Raymond James Stadium in the College Football Playoff national championship to close the 2016 season. The Bulls’ only weeknight game is a trip to face the Roadrunners on Friday, Nov. 17. They’ll also match up against former Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer, who is the first-year coach at UAB.
