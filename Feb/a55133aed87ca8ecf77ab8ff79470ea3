A 63-year-old Tarpon Springs man is dead after a crash on Oakmont Avenue in Pasco County involving three vehicles, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. An 83-year-old Tarpon Springs man was driving an SUV north on Oakmont Avenue when he stopped at Anclote Boulevard around 2:30 p.m. Thursday. Troopers say he failed to yield and entered the intersection — and into the path of the motorcycle driven by the 63-year-old man, where the two vehicles collided. The 83-year-old man’s SUV then rotated and crashed into a sedan being driven by a 34-year-old man from Holiday, the Highway Patrol said. The motorcyclist was taken to a local hospital, where he died, troopers said. The drivers of the SUV and sedan were not injured. The Highway Patrol did not name any of the drivers. A traffic homicide investigation is underway. The outcome will determine if any charges are filed or citations are issued, according to Sgt. Steve Gaskins, a spokesperson for the Highway Patrol.
