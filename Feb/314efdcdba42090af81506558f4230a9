A father has been arrested after he brought his teen son to a street race in St. Petersburg, where the boy was struck and killed by a motorcyclist going more than 100 mph, police said. Johnny Julio Martin, 35, was arrested Wednesday on a charge of child neglect in death of Ethan Julio Martin, 13, according to a news release from the St. Petersburg Police Department. On Jan. 28, a crowd formed on 28th Street North near 110th Avenue North for illegal street racing, police said. At 12:35 a.m., Ethan Martin crossed 28th Street into the path of a motorcyclist. The motorcyclist struck and killed Ethan and injured another bystander, police said. Multiple videos of the incident obtained by the Tampa Bay Times show the speeding motorcycle striking Ethan Martin. One of the videos shows Johnny Martin screaming and clutching his unresponsive son after the crash. Records show Martin was released from jail after posting $10,000 bail. Martin also received a citation for street racing as a spectator.
