A new headquarters to help tackle food insecurity in the Tampa Bay region is one step closer to becoming a reality. During a ceremony on Wednesday, Feeding Tampa Bay broke ground on its new service center that will be built off of Causeway Boulevard in Tampa. The 217,000 square foot center will double the organization’s ability to provide fresh produce and perishable goods to the more than one million people struggling with food insecurity in the region, while also reducing meal costs by about 25%. In addition to expanding food availability, the building will host a number of services aimed at helping people gain stability and live healthy lives. Thomas Mantz, the nonprofit’s chief executive officer, said the intention is for the building to become a community center as much as it is a food bank. “We want to build a different vision for how we can look after our friends and neighbors,” Mantz said. “It’s not just people who are food insecure. It’s people who are economically unstable, people who are struggling with rent or gas prices or food prices.” About 50% of the facility’s non-warehouse space will be designated to services ranging from legal consultations and insurance enrollment help, to English classes and workforce training. Providing health care will also be a focus. Those offerings will be made possible by community partners who will share space in the facility, Mantz said. That’s critical to the long term goal of creating opportunities for people to thrive. “We’ve spent years studying how to transform a community,” Mantz said. “We’re really going for it.” The $60 million dollar facility is expected to be completed in 2024. The expansion will grow Feeding Tampa Bay’s economic impact from $350 million to $460 million annually.
