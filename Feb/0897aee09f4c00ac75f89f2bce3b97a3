People planning on traveling north of the Tampa Bay area on Interstate 75 may want to find a different route. Traffic on northbound Interstate 75 in Marion County was backed up for eight miles late Wednesday morning and southbound traffic was backed up for four miles after a tractor trailer hit an overpass in Ocala. All northbound lanes were closed in the area. Northbound traffic was being diverted at exit 341, which is County Road 484, the Florida Highway Patrol reported at about 11 a.m. Wednesday. The southbound lanes remained open but the back-up in that direction was being caused by “congestion from onlookers,” troopers said in a news release. The news release said a tractor trailer carrying an “over dimensioned load” hit and damaged the SW 66th Street overpass, which is near the 347 mile marker in Ocala. Troopers said SW 66th Street, which is also known as Williams Road, also has been closed. In an updated news release at 2:30 p.m., the highway patrol reported that crews were removing damaging potions of the overpass and debris on the highway. The repairs were expected to last for at least three more hours. Northbound lanes were still closed and southbound lanes were moving slowly. Marion County is northeast of Citrus County and north of Sumter and Lake counties. Ocala is the county seat. Troopers urged motorists to seek other routes until further notice.
