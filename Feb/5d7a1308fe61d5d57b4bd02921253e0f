ST. PETERSBURG — Rays reliever Jason Adam has had a pretty good week. First, he was officially named to the U.S. roster for March’s World Baseball Classic. Then Saturday, he won his arbitration case against the Rays, as the three-person panel picked his $1.775 million request over the team’s $1.55 million offer. Adam, 31, had a breakthrough season with the Rays, posting a 1.56 ERA and eight saves over a team-high 67 appearances, 58 of which were scoreless and 42 hitless. He allowed only three of 31 inherited runners to score, and a .147 average. From an original class of 14 arbitration-eligible players, the Rays went to hearings with four. Rulings are expected in the week to come on outfielder/DH Harold Ramirez ($2.2 million request, $1.9 million offer), and relievers Ryan Thompson ($1.2 million, $1 million) and Colin Poche ($1.3 million, $1.175 million). Overall, the Rays are 7-7 in arbitration hearings over their soon-to-be 26-season history. Also, the Rays are finalizing a minor-league deal with right-handed reliever Kyle Crick, which will push their spring roster to 80. Crick, 30, has pitched parts of six seasons in the majors with the Giants, Pirates and White Sox, for whom he was 2-0, 4.06 in 14 games last season. He has a career record of 9-11, 3.56 with two saves in 194 appearances. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
