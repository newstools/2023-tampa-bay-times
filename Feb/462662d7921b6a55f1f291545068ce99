Inspired by ancient tarot decks, Holiday-based artist Patrick Stickney has interpreted mystical characters and symbolism into a collection of paintings on display at the Pasco Fine Arts Council & Gallery. “A Journey Through the Tarot” opens on Feb. 17 and runs through March 11. Stickney has long been interested in tarot cards, having researched them off and on for 40 years. He’s fascinated with not only the history of them — which goes back centuries — but also the varied visuals that different cultures have produced throughout time. “Many historians agree that the tarot was first introduced as game cards in Northern Italian cities and spread throughout Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries — each card gaining divinatory meanings that could guide a person’s future path and suggest actions to take to improve on one’s life journey,” Stickney said in a news release. The visual aspects of the cards are thought-provoking and moving, whether one believes in their power or not, he said. Works by Stickney that explore other types of symbolism will also be on display. The opening reception is at 5:30 p.m. Feb. 17. A professional tarot card reader from Three Quartz Moon will be on site and refreshments will be served.
