Jane Castor’s name appears on the ballot for Tampa mayor because a write-in candidate qualified for the March 7 election. Otherwise, she would have already won a second term. Still, she is a shoo-in to be mayor for another four years — and she deserves it. We haven’t agreed with her on every decision and would like to see a more open communication style, but she’s devoted and hardworking and has an obvious passion for making Tampa better. Voters should ignore the distraction of having a blank write-in line on the ballot, and vote for Castor. The Tampa Bay Times recommends Jane Castor for mayor.
