Two people have been taken to local trauma centers  in what the Hernando County Sheriff’s Office described as an active shooter situation in the area of Erma and Star roads in Brooksville.  In a Facebook post on Friday night, the Sheriff’s Office named Steve Roosa, 64, as a “person of interest” in the case. The shooting had stopped by the time deputies arrived at the scene, Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis said in a video posted Friday to the agency’s Facebook page. “We are now trying to develop a plan to get in — and get out any casualties,” he said. A Sheriff’s Office update posted to Facebook just before 8 p.m. Friday said Roosa had barricaded himself inside the house. Residents in the area were asked to stay inside their homes unless told otherwise by deputies. “The scene is still very active,” the post said. ”   Nienhuis said Hernando County Fire Rescue has responded to a structure fire at the same location. “As soon as we have the scene secure, we’re going to let Fire Rescue go in and put the fire out,” he said.
