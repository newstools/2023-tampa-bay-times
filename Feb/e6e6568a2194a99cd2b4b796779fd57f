Pacific Counter is set to open its third location, and the first one in Tampa, this spring. The restaurant group debuted in St. Petersburg in 2018 with its build-your-own poke bowl and sushi burrito options. There’s a second location further south in Lakewood Ranch, and others forthcoming in downtown Tampa and Sarasota. The newest spot will open in South Tampa in The Carriage Trade Plaza at 1732 S Dale Mabry Highway, in the space previously occupied by Clean Juice. “This store kind of fell into our lap and we jumped at the opportunity,” said Chitthasack Noythanongsay, a Pacific Counter cofounder in a news release. “Our downtown Tampa location has been tied up with long construction delays, so when a second gen space on Dale Mabry that could open almost immediately became available, it was an easy decision.” Hours of operation will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. daily. According to the release, the estimated opening date is sometime at the end of March. Pacific Counter is currently hiring for all positions at the new location; you can apply at pacificcounter.com.
