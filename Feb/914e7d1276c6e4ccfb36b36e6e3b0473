Billy Napier’s first full recruiting class with the Florida Gators looks a lot like the ones Dan Mullen brought to Gainesville four years ago. That’s what you’ll see from a quick peek at the rankings after Wednesday’s national signing day. Napier’s first full class sits 14th in the 247Sports composite (our source for all rankings in this story). Mullen’s three full classes ranked ninth, ninth and 12th. The reality is more nuanced; Napier’s haul is deeper than what Mullen signed and has a higher ratio of blue-chip prospects. Recruiting rankings are, of course, imperfect. The lowest-rated recruit of Mullen’s first class — Ethan White from Clearwater’s Calvary Christian High — started 21 games and was a second-team all-SEC offensive lineman last season. But Napier calls college football a talent-acquisition business, and this is a good time for a side-by-side assessment. Two quick caveats: We’re excluding transfers because the portal climate has changed too much in four years to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison. We are, however, including the three Mullen signees who didn’t make it to campus that season (though four-star linebacker Diwun Black did join the Gators later).
