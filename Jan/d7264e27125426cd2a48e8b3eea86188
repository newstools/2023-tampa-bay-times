After years of serving vibrant New American fare, the downtown St. Petersburg location of The Mill is closing. According to a Facebook update posted Tuesday morning, nearby construction is to blame. “As many of you know there has been construction behind our facility for the last several months. What you may not know is the damage caused by this construction has been massive,” reads the post on the Mill’s Facebook page. “It has become so invasive to our space that we feel we can no longer ensure the safety of our staff and patrons alike.” Chef Ted Dorsey and his business partner, Jason Griffin, opened The Mill at 200 Central Ave. Unit 200 in 2015. The restaurant quickly wowed diners with both its ambitious plates and funky, industrial decor. A second location opened in South Tampa in 2019. Hungry patrons can still visit the South Tampa location. Another Pinellas spot may be in the cards as well. “We are sincerely sorry for this, but know we will be back as this is not the end,” the post reads. “Please check back for updates as we search for a new location.” The post does not indicate what day the restaurant will close or if it has already done so.
