Three-time major champion Jordan Spieth will return this year to the PGA Tour’s Valspar Championship at Innisbrook in Palm Harbor, the tournament announced Thursday. Spieth won the 2015 Valspar in a three-hole playoff for his second career tour win. He has gone on to win 12 more tour titles. He also won the 2015 Masters, the 2015 U.S. Open and the 2017 British Open. He last played the Valspar in 2018. This year’s tournament is March 13-19 on the Copperhead Course. “We are thrilled to have Jordan return to the Copperhead,” tournament director Tracy West said in a statement. “He is certainly a fan favorite here in Tampa Bay, and we know our patrons will be out in full force supporting his return to our tournament.” Spieth’s arrival should be interesting. This year, unlike most PGA pros, he isn’t traveling on chartered flights and staying in five-star hotels. He is road tripping. He said last week that he will make the tour rounds in a recreational vehicle with his wife, Annie, and their 14-month old son, Sammy. “Just glamping, you know. Slumming it. Should be a lot of fun,” Spieth told reporters at the Sony Open in Honolulu. “The reason was kind of to have a home on the road. Got the same mattress I have at home, and we’ll leave a lot of Sammy’s stuff on the bus, therefore won’t have to pack a whole lot and can ride on it a lot in between events given the way the (tour’s) West Coast swing (falls) … and especially the Florida swing.” Spieth will pull his RV into Tampa Bay for his sixth Valspar appearance, dating to 2013, when he finished seventh. He placed in the top 20 in four of the five other appearances. Spieth joins early commitments two-time defending champion Sam Burns, Kevin Streelman, Si Woo Kim, Stewart Cink, Harry Higgs, Joel Dahmen and Brian Harman.
