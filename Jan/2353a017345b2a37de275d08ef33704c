If Tom Brady has played his last game in pewter, one of the final images of his Tampa Bay tenure will be an unflattering — and costly — one. Brady reportedly has been fined $16,444 for attempting to trip Cowboys safety Malik Hooker in the third period of Dallas’ 31-14 playoff triumph on Jan. 16. Center Ryan Jensen, who made his only appearance of the season in that contest, was fined $8,333.33 for unnecessary roughness on the same play. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport first reported the fines Saturday afternoon. Brady’s violation also officially was deemed unnecessary roughness. The incident occurred on Tampa Bay’s second possession of the second half, when Chris Godwin caught a short throw from Brady and appeared to fumble while racing upfield. After Hooker recovered, Brady slid and extended his right leg in a blatant trip attempt just before Julio Jones tackled Hooker. Some pushing and shoving ensued, resulting in roughness fines for both Jensen and Hooker (assessed the same fine as Jensen). Upon further review of the play, it was determined Godwin’s body had hit the ground before the ball came loose, and the play was reversed. The fine is Brady’s second of the season. In Week 5, he was fined $11,139 for kicking Falcons defensive lineman Grady Jarrett on the pivotal third-down play in which Jarrett was whistled for roughing the passer. That penalty, with fewer than three minutes remaining, allowed the Bucs to essentially run out the clock in a 21-15 triumph. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
