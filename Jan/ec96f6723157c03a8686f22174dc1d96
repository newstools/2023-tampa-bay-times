The Tampa City Council candidate with the most intriguing name may be George “TheHunted” Feshev, running for the citywide District 3 seat against incumbent Lynn Hurtak, former state Sen. Janet Cruz and others. Who’s hunting him? He has a suspicion, but Tampa police have been unable to solve the case that led to the nickname. Feshev, 52, of Ybor City, originally from Bulgaria, immigrated to the U.S. in 2001 and has worked as an auto mechanic, automobile exporter and consultant to exporting businesses. In his campaign, he rails against the evils of high taxes, socialism and crime. On crime, it’s personal. In June, 2019, Feshev was having dinner with his daughter when someone fired three rounds from a handgun at his 10th Avenue home. One hit a car outside and one entered the dwelling, hitting him in the back of his head. Feshev still carries the bullet lodged in his head. He suspects the shooter was a neighbor he’d had arguments with, but police have made no arrests and are still asking the public for information. The incident “turned my life around” and affected his speech, he said. “I didn’t come here to go into politics, I came here for the sunshine, the safety, to work and pay taxes.” While he was in the hospital, he said, nurses told him his survival was a miracle. “They said somebody was hunting you, you are the hunted.” He doesn’t think he’s still being hunted, but if so, “I’m not afraid. I’m ready. I don’t run from trouble.”
