Lawyers late Friday were still poring through a federal judge’s 59-page opinion that declined to reinstate suspended Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren to office. “This is not over,” Warren said Friday at the end of a brief news conference. Though he didn’t take questions or talk about what that next move might be, here are some of his legal options. Warren could appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. Even before Hinkle’s ruling, legal experts predicted that whoever was on the losing side would take their case to Atlanta. They could also take the matter directly to the Florida Supreme Court with what’s called a writ of “quo warranto” motion — Latin for “by what warrant or authority.” Warren’s lawyers considered filing such a writ soon after he was suspended. Now they would be armed with a complete record from the trial to present to the Supreme Court for consideration. His attorneys could also ask U.S. District Judge Robert L. Hinkle to reconsider his ruling. They have up to 28 days to file such a motion. Warren could also file a lawsuit against DeSantis in state court — in either Hillsborough or Leon county. There would be no deadline for that. And Warren could run for state attorney, a job Hillsborough voters elected him to twice, in 2024. Susan Lopez, the former prosecutor whom DeSantis appointed to replace him, has already announced her intention to run.
