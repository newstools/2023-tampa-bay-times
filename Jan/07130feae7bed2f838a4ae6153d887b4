Florida State’s 2023 hype continued to build Saturday when all-ACC defensive end Jared Verse announced that he will be playing another year for the Seminoles instead of entering the NFL draft. Verse starred for FSU after transferring from Albany. He recorded 45 tackles (17 for a loss) and 9 sacks in his first season in Tallahassee. He had a hand in the final sack that clinched No. 13 FSU’s Cheez-It Bowl win over Oklahoma last month. Verse received more votes than any other defensive player on the all-ACC first team. His production and size (6-foot-4, 248 pounds) has been enticing for NFL scouts. He showed up as the No. 11 overall pick in ESPN’s latest mock draft, released Wednesday. That is now out of date, given Verse’s somewhat surprising announcement. Verse is the latest FSU starter to choose to stay with the Seminoles — who look like a preseason top-10 team after finishing 10-3 this season. Quarterback Jordan Travis, running back Trey Benson and receiver Johnny Wilson are among the others, although all-ACC safety Jammie Robinson is headed to the NFL. Those key returners, combined with Clemson looking shaky down the stretch, will make the Seminoles an ACC contender, if not the favorite, heading into next season. “Future is bright in Tallahassee!” coach Mike Norvell said on Twitter after Verse’s announcement. • • • Never miss out on the latest with the Bucs, Rays, Lightning, Florida college sports and more.
