TAMPA — Tom Brady is insistent on playing Sunday’s regular-season finale at Atlanta despite the Bucs being already locked into the No. 4 playoff seed in the NFC. He will do so with the Bucs’ third left tackle protecting his blind side against the Falcons. Left tackle Donovan Smith (foot), defensive tackle Vita Vea (calf) cornerback Carlton Davis (shoulder) and defensive back Logan Ryan (knee) missed a third straight day of practice Friday and are out for Sunday’s game, coach Todd Bowles said Friday. Outside linebacker Carl Nassib, who has been battling a pectoral injury, also won’t play against the Falcons. Backup left tackle Josh Wells went on injured reserve a couple of weeks ago with a torn patellar tendon. That means the Bucs will be down to their third tackle, former Seminole High and Florida Atlantic star Brandon Walton. The Bucs got some good news, as well, as receiver Julio Jones (knee/illness), who missed practice Wednesday and Thursday, returned on Friday. Cornerback Jamel Dean (toe), safety Mike Edwards (hamstring/hip) and right tackle Tristan Wirfs all practiced Friday. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
