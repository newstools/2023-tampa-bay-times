TAMPA — Tom Brady and most of the Bucs starters are expected to play Sunday at Atlanta in a game that won’t impact their status as the No. 4 seed in the NFC. But at least two key players —left tackle Donovan Smith (foot) and defensive tackle Vita Vea (calf) — weren’t practicing Wednesday during the portion open to the media: Both played in Sunday’s 30-24 win over the Panthers to clinch the NFC South. There was some good news at cornerback: Carlton Davis, who missed Sunday’s game with a shoulder injury, returned to practice. Outside linebacker Carl Nassib (pectoral) and cornerback Jamel Dean (toe) were practicing. Nassib did not play against the Panthers. Center Ryan Jensen (knee) began his second week of practice and can be activated at any time but coach Todd Bowles has said he doesn’t expect him to be active this week.
