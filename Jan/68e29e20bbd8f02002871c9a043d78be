A pedestrian was killed and another hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries when a driver behind the wheel of a pickup truck struck the pair as they crossed a Dunedin street Saturday evening, the Pinellas County Sherriff’s Office said. Investigators say 52-year-old Anna Walker-Parisi was driving a 2022 Toyota Tacoma when she hit 79-year-old Nazire Blloshmi and 47-year-old Stela Mema as she was turning left onto Edgewater Drive at around 6:50 p.m., according to a news release. At the time of the crash, Blloshmi was being assisted by Mema to cross Edgewater Drive in a designated crosswalk, according to the sherrif’s office. A trauma alert was declared and an air transport unit dispatched. Blloshmi was transported to a local hospital where she was later pronounced dead. Mema suffered non-life threatening injuries and was also transported to a local hospital, according to the sherriff’s office. At least 12 bicyclists, 31 motorcyclists and 35 pedestrians were killed in Pinellas County last year, according to estimates from Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles published in late December. Investigators say speed and impairment do not appear to be factors in the Dunedin crash. The investigation is ongoing.
