Hard-hitting and slick-fielding third baseman Scott Rolen was elected to baseball’s Hall of Fame. Rolen, a seven-time All-Star who retired after the 2012 season, had a .281 average with 316 homers and 1,287 RBIs for the Phillies (1996-2002), Cardinals (2002-07), Blue Jays (2008-09) and Reds (2009-12). He was a unanimous pick as the 1997 National League Rookie of the Year and won eight Gold Gloves. He is the 18th third baseman elected to the Hall. Rolen received 297 votes, just clearing the 292 needed to be elected with the 75 percent threshold. First baseman Todd Helton, who played his entire 17-year career in Colorado, received 281 votes. Closer Billy Wagner got 265, outfielder Andruw Jones 226 and Tampa native Gary Sheffield 214. Rolen will be inducted July 23 in Cooperstown, New York, along with Fred McGriff, the Tampa native and original Devil Ray who was elected last month by the contemporary era committee. • • • Sign up for the Rays Report weekly newsletter to get fresh perspectives on the Tampa Bay Rays and the rest of the majors from sports columnist John Romano.
