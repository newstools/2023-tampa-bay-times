A hit-and-run driver struck a 42-year-old man walking along the edge of a road in Hillsborough County on Sunday night. The pedestrian was headed east of Branch Forbes Road in Plant City on US-92, a road that lacks sidewalks along many stretches. He was struck by a vehicle heading west around 8 p.m., according to a press release from the Florida Highway Patrol. The driver, whose age and gender are unknown, fled the scene. The suspect vehicle may be a Toyota or Nissan, officials said, based on evidence left at the site of the accident. The pedestrian has suffered critical injuries, according to the press release. Officials have asked anyone with information about this case to contact the Florida Highway Patrol at 813-558-1800. Tampa Bay is among the worst metropolitan areas in the country for pedestrian deaths. Late last year, the urban development advocacy group Smart Growth America released a report that analyzed pedestrian death data. It ranked the Tampa-St. Pete-Clearwater area as the fourth most dangerous place to take a walk in the nation.
