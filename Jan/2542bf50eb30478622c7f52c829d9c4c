Grab your eyeliner — Fall Out Boy is coming back to Tampa. The pop-punk band will swing by the MidFlorida CreditUnion Amphitheatre on July 25 during their upcoming stadium tour promoting their eighth studio album, “So Much (For) Stardust.” The venue is a bit bigger than the one Fall Out Boy played last time they were in Tampa Bay, performing at an elaborate Stanley Cup ring celebration for the Tampa Bay Lightning at Jeff Vinik’s home in 2021. Elder emos will be pleased to note that Bring Me the Horizon will provide support on the tour. Royal & the Serpent and Carr will also open. Pre-sale begins Thursday at 10 a.m., with general sale beginning the same time Friday. Visit falloutboy.com/tour for more information.
