For years, the annual Gasparilla Music Festival has welcomed bands in February or March to the Kiley Garden and Curtis Hixon Park for an outdoor festival in downtown Tampa. But things will have to change this year. Kiley Garden is closed due to water intrusion issues, meaning the festival has to look for another venue. In an email to the Tampa Bay Times, Tampa city spokesperson Lauren Rozyla said that “Tampa Parks and Recreation is actively working with the organization to find a suitable alternative location for the event.” David Cox, executive director of the Gasparilla Music Foundation, said there haven’t been any announcements regarding dates or lineup because they were hoping to get resolution on a venue by the end of 2022. He said they can’t say exactly when the festival will happen yet but have a weekend they’re working on. The Gasparilla Music Foundation, who produces the festival, emailed this statement. “Since we were informed of the waterproofing issues underneath Kiley Gardens and the fact that the city won’t currently issue a permit for the Gasparilla Music Festival to use that park, we have been working on an alternative plan to create an amazing festival experience for 2023 in downtown Tampa. Unfortunately, we still have some issues that haven’t been resolved and are working through those now. We remain optimistic there will be a GMF 2023 with some exciting new changes, and we look forward to being able to announce those details soon. 2022 was our foundation’s best year. Our festival had its best year in ticket sales, sponsorships, and memberships, and we are excited to keep that momentum going and growing our festival in 2023 and beyond.”
