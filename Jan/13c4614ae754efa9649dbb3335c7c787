He found love because of the show Meyer met his wife, Genevieve Sheehan, through a mutual love of “Jeopardy!” According to a New York Times Vows story, he recruited her to play games together on a “Jeopardy!” fan site and developed an internet friendship with her before Sheehan appeared as a contestant on the real show in 2009. Later, they met in person and fell in love quickly. “Did we care that she lost on the show?” Sheehan’s father told the New York Times. “No, because in reality she had won, as she had won her husband.” Love of the game runs in the family During one episode, Meyer revealed to host Ken Jennings that his mother, who recently passed away, was a big “Jeopardy” fan.
