Construction is now underway on a 37-story luxury hotel and condominium tower in downtown Tampa, according to a media release from the developer, Pendry Hotels & Resorts. Pendry Tampa, located along the Riverwalk at 100 S Ashley Drive, will feature 220 hotel rooms and 207 condos. The location was once tapped as the site for Trump Tower Tampa, but that project failed to get off the ground. The building has already brought in more than $160 million in condo sales, though the developer would not say how many units had sold. “We are seeing interested buyers from across the country who recognize the incredible experience of owning a home that includes all the benefits of living with luxury hotel services and amenities,” said Tina Necrason, executive vice president of residential for Montage International, which owns Pendry. Condos start at $1,175,000. Residents will have access to all hotel amenities. This includes a spa, several dining options, a rooftop pool and a fitness center.
