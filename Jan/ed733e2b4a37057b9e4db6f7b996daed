Today, Tarpon Springs will bask in its 117th annual Epiphany celebration, a richly choreographed religious and cultural event that brings more than 20,000 visitors to the North Pinellas city every year. Eastern Christian denominations celebrate Epiphany to commemorate the baptism of Jesus Christ by John the Baptist in the Jordan River and the manifestation of the Holy Trinity. Along with a Eucharistic service, the celebrations typically feature a blessing of the waters and a daylong festival with food and dancing. Tarpon Springs hosts the largest Epiphany celebration in the western hemisphere. A team of Tampa Bay Times reporters and photographers is in place to chronicle the day — from the solemn Divine Liturgy at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral to the climactic dive for the cross.
