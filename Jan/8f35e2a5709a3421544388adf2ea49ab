After a nearly two-year delay caused by the pandemic, Disney World has finally announced an April 4 opening date for the futuristic coaster TRON Lightcycle Run at Magic Kingdom. The attraction is based on the world first created in the 1982 sci-fi film starring Jeff Bridges as a computer programmer and video game developer who is transported inside a mainframe computer where he interacts with programs in his attempt to escape. The film was a moderate success and later grew to become a cult hit, especially among video gamers. A sequel titled “Tron: Legacy” was released in 2010 and that is the basis for this attraction, according to a Disney news release. “Guests will feel as if they’ve been digitized and transported into the Grid for a special Lightcycle race,” a Disney news release said. “It’s Team Blue against the Grid’s menacing Programs, Team Orange. The goal is to be the first to race through eight Energy Gates and secure victory.” The attraction will be one of the fastest coasters at any Disney theme park in the world. A similar Tron ride debuted at Shanghai Disneyland in 2016 and is enormously popular. In 2017, it was announced the attraction would come to Magic Kingdom in time for Disney World’s 50th anniversary in 2021. The pandemic halted its construction in Tomorrowland, on land adjacent to Space Mountain. That work also disrupted operation of the Walt Disney World Railroad that passes by the Tron site. The train returned to operation a few weeks ago. The ride’s motorbike-inspired cars resemble vehicles in the “Tron” movies. Riders lean forward and grip handlebars, while a pad secures passengers from behind. The Shanghai ride reaches 59 miles per hour. Before the attraction officially opens, cast members and Annual Passholders will get to preview the ride, Disney’s announcement said.
