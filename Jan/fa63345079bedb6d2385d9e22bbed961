ST. PETERSBURG — The contracts the Rays signed pitchers Jeffrey Springs and Pete Fairbanks to provide hefty guarantees, Springs getting $31 million over four years and Fairbanks $12 million over three. Both give the players the chance to more than double their earnings through a series of incentive and escalator clauses, but they will require extraordinary performances to max out the total potential values. Springs, for example, would have to win four consecutive Cy Young awards, among other things, to get the full $65.75 million. Fairbanks would have to be named the league’s top reliever four times to get his full $24.6 million.
