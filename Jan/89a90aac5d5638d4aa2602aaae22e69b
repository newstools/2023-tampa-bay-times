ST. PETERSBURG — The Rays secured another key member of their pitching staff on a long-term deal Friday, signing reliever Pete Fairbanks to a three-year contract for a guaranteed $12 million that with incentives and a fourth-year option could be worth up to $24.6 million. Fairbanks, 29, is coming off a dazzling, albeit limited 2022 performance, allowing only three earned runs over 24 appearances after returning in mid-July from a spring lat muscle tear. Under terms of the deal, Fairbanks will get salaries of $3.667 million in 2023, 2024 and 2025, with additional incentives available. The Rays hold an option for 2026 at $7 million but could increase it to up to $11 million. There is also a $1 million buyout. Fairbanks had been headed to arbitration with the Rays, having filed for $1.9 million with the team offering $1.5 million. He is the second Rays pitcher to sign a long-term deal this week. Starter Jeffrey Springs on Wednesday agreed to a three-year deal for a guaranteed $31 million that, with a $15 million option for 2027 and some lofty incentive and escalator clauses, could be worth as much as $65.75 million. Fairbanks left the Rays’ season-ending playoff game against Cleveland with numbness and a “pins and needles” feeling in his right middle and index fingers, but team officials said a few days later he was fine. He was sidelined twice during the 2021 season with right shoulder issues and has had Tommy John elbow surgery twice.
