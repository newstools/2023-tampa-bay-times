The Tampa Bay Times is switching to a new event database Feb. 1, and here’s how you can get your event featured. This new system, called Evvnt, is a tool that venues and organizations can use to enter their own events. In fact, with this system, venues and organizations must enter their own events for them to appear in our calendars. Once the event is submitted, it goes into a pool of Tampa Bay events managed by our team of editors. If an event is chosen for publication, it will appear on our website, tampabay.com, and in the pages of our newspaper’s tbt* Weekend section, where it will reach more than 830,000 readers weekly, according to the 2022 Nielsen Scarborough Report. The good news? It’s easy to do. To enter events, simply click here and fill in the form. Events need to be submitted at least 10 days before publication date to be considered. Go here to browse all events currently in the system. We’re also offering a new option for event creators: MyTBtickets, a free ticket management service. Designed to work with events and venues of all sizes, MyTBtickets includes everything you need to create a full ticketing site, customizable ticket levels, real-time ticket sales tracking, day-of-event check-in services and more. Event creators using MyTBtickets will also have their events listed on tampabay.com and in tbt* Weekend. Go to mytbtickets.com for more information, or email info@mytbtickets.com. For questions about submitting your own event into our database, email calendar@tampabay.com.
