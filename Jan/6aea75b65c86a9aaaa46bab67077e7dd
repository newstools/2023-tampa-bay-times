Pinellas County Animal Services announced Wednesday it will resume full dog operations immediately. It had stopped the intake and adoptions of dogs in early December because of an outbreak of canine pneumovirus. Canine pneumovirus is generally not fatal for dogs, but the highly contagious upper respiratory infection spreads quickly and causes nasal discharge, coughing and wheezing. The closure was forced after 26% of the shelter’s dog population became infected in one day. A press release from Pinellas County Animal Services reported, “All dog areas have been sanitized and both intake and adoptions have resumed. Adoption fees are waived until January 31.” To learn more about Animal Services operations, visit pinellas.gov/animalservices, or call 727-582-2600.
