A New York investment bank is setting up shop in Water Street Tampa. PEI Global Partners, which specializes in mergers, acquisitions and other transactions in the energy and infrastructure industries, has signed a lease to open a new Florida headquarters at Thousand & One, the primary office tower in Water Street Tampa. The company plans to lease 2,251 square feet by this spring at 1001 Water St., according to a statement by Water Street Tampa developers Strategic Property Partners, a partnership between Lightning owner Jeff Vinik and Bill Gates’ Cascade Investment. PEI anticipates staffing 10 bankers and administrative workers — a mix of new hires and employees relocated from New York — in the office by early 2024. “This new location allows our employees, guests and clients to be surrounded by a rich, amenity-filled neighborhood,” PEI managing partner Kevin Phillips said in a statement. “The combination of Thousand & One’s thoughtful design, Water Street Tampa’s highly sought-after attributes and Tampa’s pro-business climate create an ideal environment for our company to attract and retain talent.” When the company arrives, employees will have two new dining options nearby. French bistro and bar Boulon Brasserie opened this week on the ground floor of Thousand & One. And fast-casual Asian chain Wagamama announced this week that it will open its first Florida location across the street at 1050 Water St., on the ground floor of residential tower Asher, on Feb. 11.
