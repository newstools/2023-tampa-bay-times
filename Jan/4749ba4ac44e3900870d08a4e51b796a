After spending nearly a decade building the largest residence in Hillsborough County, local physician and philanthropist Kiran Patel may be one step closer to completing his palatial Carrollwood home. Patel purchased the 17-acre property off Dale Mabry Highway in 2003 for $3.2 million and broke ground in 2013. Earlier this month, Patel transferred ownership of three homes on the site to his children, Sheetal K. Patel, Shilen Patel, Sonali K. Judd and her husband Scott Judd, according to records filed with Hillsborough County. Patel told the Tampa Bay Business Journal that his children are “moving in gradually” and that his home should be complete by March. Patel did not return requests for comment. Several viral TikToks showcasing the compound’s pink archways and turrets have sparked new buzz about the highly-anticipated “Surya Estates.” The main home is 32,000-square-feet. It includes a 15,300-square-foot great hall, with stairways on either side continuing on to second-floor balconies. There are two, 8,400-square-foot wings, each with its own courtyard. The home was built with pink sandstone imported from India and the design blends Persian, Islamic and Indian architecture. “Once you walk in, it will be very modern, very American, very functional,” Patel told the Tampa Bay Times in 2016. He noted that once the estate is completed “each (family) can live in a place that’s comfortable for them.”
