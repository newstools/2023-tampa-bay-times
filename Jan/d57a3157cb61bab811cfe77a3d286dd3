The Florida Highway Patrol is searching for the driver who troopers say fatally struck a motorcyclist with a flatbed truck Wednesday in Tampa and then drove away. The crash happened about 9 p.m. on U.S. 301 near the entrance ramp to the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway when the driver of the flatbed truck heading south turned left into the path of a motorcyclist riding north, troopers said. The motorcyclist, a 49-year-old Tampa man, died at the scene. The Highway Patrol does not typically release the names of people killed in crashes, citing Marsyâ€™s Law. After the crash, the truck driver drove away and was last seen heading east on the S.R. 618. The truck was a light-colored, flatbed tow truck loaded with a short yellow school bus, troopers said. Troopers asked anyone with information on the crash to contact the Florida Highway Patrol by dialing *FHP (*347) or Crimes Stoppers by dialing **TIPS (**8477).
