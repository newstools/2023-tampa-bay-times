It’s been a few years since the full iteration of Wilco has played in Tampa Bay, so fans of the Chicago-based alt-rockers will be excited to know the band is back on tour, with a stop at Clearwater’s Ruth Eckerd Hall on April 20. Tickets range from $53.25-$103.25 and go on sale at 10 a.m. Jan. 20 at rutheckerdhall.com or by calling the theater’s central ticket office at 727-791-7400 or visiting it noon-6 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday and Saturday and 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Friday. The ticket office opens two hours prior to show time. The tour announcement is timed with the LP and CD release of the band’s acclaimed 2022 album, “Cruel Country,” which The Associated Press called “an immensely rich 21-track, roughly 80-minute deep dive into America that is a raw and engaging take on our tumultuous times.” Also in honor of the album’s release is the return of the third installment of Wilcoworld Radio, which will stream for free on wilcoworld.net now through Jan. 24. It features a DJ hour from each band member, rare and unheard recordings of recent live shows and a “Cruel Country” deep dive with front man Jeff Tweedy. There will also be a behind-the-scenes conversation on the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot 20th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition, which has earned two Grammy nominations for Best Historical Album and Best Album Notes.
