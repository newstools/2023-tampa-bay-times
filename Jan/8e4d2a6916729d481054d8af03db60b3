ORLANDO — UCF defensive back Justin Hodges has been dismissed from the team following his arrest on a charge of home invasion robbery with a firearm and a mask. The UCF athletic department said in a statement on Friday that Hodges had been let go from the football program and that the university had initiated a review of his conduct. Orange County Jail records show that Hodges was booked by the Orlando Police Department on Thursday on the first-degree felony charge. According to a police statement, a victim told police officers that several men, including Hodges, battered him last week after barging into his apartment in downtown Orlando. They threatened him with their guns “in an extremely violent manner” and stole his phone and recording equipment, according to the police. The victim’s former girlfriend had stopped by the apartment the day before wearing clothing belonging to Hodges. The victim discarded the clothing, apparently out the window since it was found on a lower floor breezeway, according to police. The former girlfriend then returned to the apartment the next day with Hodges and two other men. When the victim opened the door, he was pushed inside and struck in the face, according to police. Online court records showed no attorney listed for Hodges. During an interview with detectives, Hodges minimized his role in the confrontation, saying he only had been helping the former girlfriend get her possessions from the apartment, according to police.
