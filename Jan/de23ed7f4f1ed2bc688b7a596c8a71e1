The exit ramp from southbound Interstate 75 to Interstate 4 has reopened after a fatal single-car crash early Thursday. A woman was driving a Volkswagen Jetta south on I-75 near milepost 262 at a high rate of speed about 3:20 a.m. when she lost control and struck several construction barrels and a guardrail, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The Jetta came to rest blocking the inside lane of the ramp. The ramp remained closed until shortly before 9 a.m. as troopers investigated and worked to clear the roadway. The Highway Patrol has not released the woman’s age or city of residence. The agency typically does not release the names of people involved in crashes due to Marsy’s Law.
