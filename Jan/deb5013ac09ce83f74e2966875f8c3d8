TAMPA — Defenseman Victor Hedman will return to the Lightning lineup for tonight’s home game against Columbus after becoming a new father for the second time. Hedman left the Lightning before Friday’s game in Winnipeg to return to Tampa to be with his wife, Sanna, for the birth of the couple’s second boy. Viggo Hedman was born Monday morning in Tampa, weighing 8 pounds, 4 ounces. He was almost 21 inches long. Hedman returned to the ice for today’s morning skate and received congratulatory stick taps from his teammates in the post-skate stretching circle welcoming him back. Hedman’s first son, Rio, was born on Oct. 14, 2020, just two weeks after the Lightning won the first of back-to-back Stanley Cup championships, with Hedman earning the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP. • • • Sign up for Lightning Strikes, a weekly newsletter from Bolts beat writer Eduardo A.
