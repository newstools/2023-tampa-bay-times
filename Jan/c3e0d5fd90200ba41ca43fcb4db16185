Lightning defenseman Mikhail Sergachev was fined $5,000 by the NHL Friday for roughing Conor Garland late in Thursday’s 5-4 win over Vancouver at Amalie Arena. The Canucks forward tried to take a late swipe at Lightning goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy during Vancouver’s furious finish, and Sergachev cleared him out with a punch to the face. The incident, which occurred with 41 seconds left to play, was reviewed by the NHL’s Department of Player Safety. The league announced the fine Friday afternoon, adding that it was the maximum fine allowed under the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The money will go to the NHL players’ emergency assistance fund. Earlier, Sergachev, playing in his 400th career NHL game, recorded an assist on the Lightning’s first goal, his 30th point of the season. • • • Sign up for Lightning Strikes, a weekly newsletter from Bolts beat writer Eduardo A.
