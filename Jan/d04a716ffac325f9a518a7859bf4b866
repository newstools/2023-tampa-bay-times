Hillsborough County fire officials said an LED Christmas tree caught fire and caused an overnight blaze in a two-story Apollo Beach house late Friday night. Several people called 911 and reported the fire in the 6400 block of Grenada Island Avenue just after 11:15 p.m., according to a Hillsborough County Fire Rescue news release. The callers told dispatchers flames were visible on the house’s second floor. A resident saw the LED Christmas tree catch fire, which then spread to several walls in the upstairs room, according to a fire investigator. When fire crews arrived on scene, they siphoned hoses through the house’s front door and were able to keep the fire contained to one room, according to the news release. After searching the home, firefighters determined everyone was able to safely evacuate and nobody was injured. Photos provided by the fire officials show damaged walls and debris strewn across the floor.
