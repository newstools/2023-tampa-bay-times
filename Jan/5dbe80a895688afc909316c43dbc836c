A 25-year-old woman was fatally shot and her 7-year-old daughter was wounded Sunday when the woman’s current boyfriend and her ex-boyfriend exchanged gunfire inside a Clearwater apartment, police said. The shootings happened about 6:30 p.m. in an apartment on the 600 block of Fairwood Avenue, according to the Clearwater Police Department. Nicolshia Washington’s ex-boyfriend, Lavaris Delapierre, was dropping off the girl when he got into a confrontation with Washington’s current boyfriend, Stacy Cross, and the two men exchanged gunfire, police said. Washington and her daughter were both shot during the gunfight. Washington died later Sunday at Mease Countryside Hospital. Her daughter remained hospitalized at All Children’s Hospital in St. Petersburg, according to police. Detectives spoke with Cross and were searching for Delapierre, who was wanted on multiple charges including felony murder and armed burglary, when he turned himself in on Monday, police said.
