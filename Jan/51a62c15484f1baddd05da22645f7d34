A man was critically injured Sunday in St. Petersburg’s Fossil Park when an altercation led to gunfire, police said. Officers were called to the park, 6635 Dr. MLK St. N., for reports of gunshots around 8:15 p.m. and found a 36-year-old man who had been shot, according to the St. Petersburg Police Department. Police said the man was near the park’s basketball courts when he was involved in an altercation that led to shots being fired. The man was taken to a hospital with critical injuries. In an updated news release Monday afternoon, police said the man is “in critical but stable condition.” Investigators believe several men who were at the park before leaving in a white car could have information about the case and they would like to talk to those men, the release said. Police did not release the name or any additional information about the man who was shot.
