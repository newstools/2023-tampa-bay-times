“Selling Tampa” may have been canceled, but two of its cast members are headed back to Netflix for a shot at love. Colony Reeves and Anne-Sophie Petit-Frere have joined the cast of “Perfect Match,” a new reality show. Both women are accomplished real estate moguls who work at Tampa Bay-based firm Allure Reality, but have yet to find success in the romance department. Here’s what we know about the upcoming show: The setting: a sexy tropical island paradise. The cast: a mashup of reality stars from shows including “Love Is Blind,” “Too Hot to Handle,” “The Mole,” “The Circle,” “The Ultimatum,” “Sexy Beasts” and “Twentysomethings: Austin.” The host: Nick Lachey, who Netflix reality fans may recognize from co-hosting “Love Is Blind” and “The Ultimatum” with his wife, Vanessa. It doesn’t appear that she will be joining him this time. The shtick: Hot reality stars will search for love while using strategy to make it to the end, where one couple will be deemed the titular perfect match. “The most compatible couples will play matchmaker, breaking up other couples and sending them on dates with brand-new singles they’ll invite to the villa,” reads a release from Netflix. “Will they create better matches, or will they create chaos?” The release schedule: The first four episodes release on Netflix on Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day. Four more episodes will drop Feb. 21, and the final four will come out Feb. 28.
