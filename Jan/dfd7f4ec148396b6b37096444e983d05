Flight delays were reported across the U.S. on Monday after “issues” at an air traffic control center in Miami. In response to customer complaints and social media posts bemoaning the delays, the Tampa International Airport attempted to clear the air. “Florida air space is not closed. Miami Air Traffic Control is having a few issues at the moment, but almost all flights in/out of TPA are unaffected. Please contact the FAA for further info. We’re wishing you safe travels!” the airport tweeted. The Federal Aviation Administration followed up by issuing a ground stop for all aircraft trying to enter or fly out of Florida. “The FAA has slowed the volume of traffic into Florida airspace due to an air traffic computer issue that is being resolved...The ERAM system is a modern computer system at the air traffic centers that handle en route traffic,” the agency told WESH 2. Miami International Airport said Monday afternoon that a “radar data link outage” was to blame but that it had “been resolved and planes are slowly being allowed to depart.” ©2023 New York Daily News.
