TAMPA — Bucs nose tackle Vita Vea, sidelined the last two games with a calf injury, is expected to play in today’s de facto playoff game against the run-oriented Panthers. A victory gives Tampa Bay (7-8) the NFC South title and home-field advantage in the opening round of the playoffs. Vea, absent since his four-play cameo against the 49ers on Dec. 11, practiced on a limited basis Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and is active today. His presence alongside fellow veteran behemoth Akiem Hicks immediately solidifies Tampa Bay’s interior run defense against a team that ran for 320 yards in last weekend’s 14-point victory against Detroit. The Bucs are allowing 120.3 rushing yards a contest but have surrendered only 88.8 in the six full games in which Vea and Hicks have played alongside each other. Other injured players who are active today include cornerback Jamel Dean (toe), left tackle Donovan Smith (foot), receiver Julio Jones (knee), and safeties Mike Edwards (hamstring) and Antoine Winfield Jr. (ankle). Among the inactive players are cornerback Carlton Davis (shoulder), outside linebacker Carl Nassib (pectoral) and tight end Cameron Brate (healthy scratch). Nassib’s absence means second-year edge rusher Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and fourth-year counterpart Anthony Nelson could be forced to play every defensive snap for the third consecutive game. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
