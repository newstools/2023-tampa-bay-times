TAMPA — A 12-year-old was killed and a 14-year-old injured during a shooting Sunday afternoon in Tampa. Officers were called to a home on the 2600 block of East 111th Avenue for a reported shooting just before 2 p.m., according to a news release from the Tampa Police Department. Officers found a 12-year-old dead inside with a gunshot wound to the upper body. The teen was transported to a local hospital to receive treatment for a gunshot wound, also to the upper body.
