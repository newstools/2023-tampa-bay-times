To replenish two of their most decimated spots, the Bucs are elevating offensive tackle Justin Skule and outside linebacker Ifeadi Odenigbo from the practice squad for Sunday’s regular-season finale against the Falcons. The moves come a day after coach Todd Bowles declared veteran left tackle Donovan Smith and key edge-rushing backup Carl Nassib out for the contest. The outside linebacker shortage has forced Anthony Nelson to play every defensive snap the last three games and Joe Tryon-Shoyinka to play all except one during that same span. Odenigbo, a 28-year-old NFL journeyman, was signed to the practice squad in late December. He has played 54 career games with four different teams, collecting 84 career tackles and 14 sacks. Skule, a sixth-round pick by the 49ers in 2019, played 15 games (starting eight) for San Francisco during its Super Bowl season in 2019. He tore his ACL the following summer and hasn’t appeared in an NFL game since. He has spent two different stints on the Bucs practice squad this season. • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
