Busch Gardens has started the new year with a buy one, get one free sale on its Fun Card that gets you unlimited admission to the Tampa theme park for the rest of the year. The park is also bringing back its Preschool Card, which offers free admission to kids 5 and younger, provided their parents register in advance. The offer, which gets you two Fun Cards for $132.99, includes a free Adventure Island Fun Card. The sale ends Jan. 15 at buschgardenstampa.com. The Fun Card does not include parking, which is currently $30, or discounts on food or shopping like some of the higher-tier annual passes offer. For Florida residents, the free Preschool Card allows admission for the rest of the year for ages 5 and younger. You must register online before Feb. 26 at buschgardens.com/preschoolcard.
