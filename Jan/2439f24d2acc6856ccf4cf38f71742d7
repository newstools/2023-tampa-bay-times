A 19-year-old man was killed in a horse training accident early Saturday morning at Tampa Bay Downs, the track’s announcer confirmed to the Tampa Bay Times. Tampa Bay Downs identified the man as Daniel Quintero, an exercise rider at the course, the facility said in a social media post. Jockeys observed a moment of silence for Quintero at the track just before 12:30 p.m., according to the facility. Two horses were involved in the accident, which occurred on the facility’s track, according to Jason Beem, a track announcer at Tampa Bay Downs. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office was notified of the incident around 7 a.m. and paramedics pronounced the man dead at the scene, according to sheriff’s spokesperson Marco Villarreal. The man’s family was notified of his death, Beem said. Both horses were unharmed in the accident. “The entire racetrack community expresses its condolences to his family members and friends,” Tampa Bay Downs posted to Twitter.
