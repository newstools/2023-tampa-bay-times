While a second consecutive NFC South title affords the Bucs the short-term benefit of a home playoff game, it also comes with a long-term cost. A sturdy 2023 schedule. Sunday’s developments in the final week of the regular season locked in Tampa Bay’s regular-season slate for next season. As division champions, the Bucs draw games against the champs of the NFC East (home vs. Eagles), NFC West (at 49ers) and AFC East (at Bills). In addition to the six annual division contests (two each against the Saints, Falcons and Panthers), they also play all four NFC North and AFC South teams. Translation: While every team in their division could feature a new starting quarterback next season, the Bucs are almost certain to face a series of bona fide franchise QBs, including Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields and (unless he retires) Aaron Rodgers. Moreover, only eight of their 17 games will be at Raymond James Stadium; in 2023, the AFC hosts all of the 17th games that were added to the schedule in 2021. Here’s the Bucs’ home/road breakdown (the complete NFL schedule, including dates and kickoff times, is expected to be announced in May): 2023 home opponents Falcons Panthers Bears Lions Jaguars Saints Eagles Titans 2023 road opponents Falcons Bills Panthers Packers Texans Colts Vikings Saints 49ers • • • Sign up for the Bucs RedZone newsletter to get updates and analysis on the latest team and NFL news from Bucs beat writer Joey Knight.
