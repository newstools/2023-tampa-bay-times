A man has been charged with second-degree murder with a weapon after another man was stabbed multiple times at a New Year’s Eve party early Sunday morning. Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrested the suspect, Plasido Castro Bibiano, 37, on Sunday. Around 5:15 a.m. that day, deputies arrived to the Palm Flats Apartments in Tampa and found a man with multiple stab wounds in the roadway, Hillsborough County officials said in a news release. He died from his injuries. The victim was allegedly attending an outdoor New Year’s Eve party when he became involved in an altercation with Castro Bibiano, law enforcement officials said. The suspect allegedly broke a beer bottle and stabbed the victim multiple times. “This is not the way to start the new year,” Chad Chronister, sheriff for Hillsborough County, said in the news release. “When anger turns into violence, lives can be lost, and families destroyed.”
