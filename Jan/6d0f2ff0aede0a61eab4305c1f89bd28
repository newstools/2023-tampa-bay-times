Troopers were searching Thursday for the driver who fatally struck a man as he tried to cross U.S. 92 in Seffner. The crash happened shortly before 8 p.m. Wednesday as the 74-year-old Tampa man, who was using a walker, tried to cross U.S. 92 west of Williams Road and was struck by a car, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The pedestrian died from his injuries at the scene of the crash. The driver of the car drove away after the collision, troopers said. Investigators found pieces of the vehicle’s side mirror that indicate it was a black Honda sedan. The man’s walker was not found at the crash scene, so troopers believe it was dragged by the car or got stuck on it. The Highway Patrol did not name the man who was killed. Anyone with information about the crash or the driver is asked to call the Highway Patrol at 813-558-1800. From a cellphone, callers can dial *FHP (*374) or contact Crime Stoppers at **TIPS (**8477).
